<p>PREFACE</p>
</div>

<p>To describe military scenes is always to rouse
the keenest scrutiny from military men. I write
this foreword not to deprecate criticism, but to
remind the professional reader that, while the
scenes I have described are all from experience,
the aim in writing them was not for technical
exactness, often confusing to the lay reader, but
rather for the purpose of giving a general picture
of the fun and work at a training camp.
</p>
<p>Nowadays we are making history so fast that
readers may have to be reminded that last summer
occurred the mobilization on the Mexican
border of most of the regular army and many
regiments of the National Guard, a fact which
considerably affected conditions at Plattsburg.
</p>
<p>The &#8220;Buzzard Song,&#8221; which my company used
with such satisfaction on the hike, was written by
a camp-mate, John A. Straley, who has kindly allowed
me to use it, with a few minor changes.

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>Though you kissed me good-by with affection,
you know there was amusement in the
little smile with which you watched me go. I,
a modest citizen, accustomed to shrink from
publicity, was exposed in broad day in a badly
fitting uniform, in color inconspicuous, to be
sure, but in pattern evidently military and aggressive.
What a guy I felt myself, and how
every smile or laugh upon the street seemed to
mean Me! The way to the railroad station
had never seemed so long, nor so thronged with
curious folk. I felt myself very silly.
</p>
<p>Thus it was a relief when I met our good pastor,
for I knew at the first glance of his eye that
my errand and my uniform meant to him, as
they did to me, something important. So strong
was this comforting sense that I even forgot
what importance he might attach to them.
</p>
<p>But fixing me with his eye as I stopped and
greeted him (being within easy hurrying distance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
of the station) he said in pained surprise:
&#8220;And so you are going to Plattsburg?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then I remembered that he was an irreconcilable
pacifist. Needing no answer, he went on:
&#8220;I am sorry to see that the militarist spirit has
seized you too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Now if anything vexes me, it is to be told
that I am a militarist. &#8220;Not that, sir,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;War is the last thing that I want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Train a man to wield a weapon,&#8221; he rejoined,
&#8220;and he will itch to use it.&#8221; I think
we were both a little sententious because of
the approach of the train. &#8220;Your argument is,
I suppose, that the country is in danger?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; I replied.
</p>
<p>He raised both hands. &#8220;Madness! No one
will attack us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I refrained from telling him that with so much
at stake I was unwilling to accept even treaty
assurances on that point. He went on. &#8220;The
whole world is mad with desire to slay. But I
would rather have my son killed than killing
others.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He is proud of his son, but he is prouder of
his daughter. Said I, &#8220;If war comes, and we
are unprepared for it, you might have not only
your son killed, but your daughter too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Horrified, he had not yet begun to express
himself on the impossibility of invasion, when
the train came. So we parted. To tell the truth,
I am not sorry that he feels so: it is very ideal.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
And I regret no longer having my own fine feeling
of security. It is only a year or so ago that
I was just such a pacifist as he.
</p>
<p>If I in my new uniform was at home a curiosity,
when I reached Boston I found myself merely
one among many, for the North Station was
full of Plattsburgers. There is great comfort
in being like other folk. A thick crowd it was
at our special train, raw recruits with their admiring
women-folk or fun-poking friends. The
departure was not like the leaving of soldiers
for the front, such as we saw in July when the
boys went to Texas. We should come back not
with wounds, but with a healthy tan and much
useful experience. So every one was jolly, except
for a young couple that were walking up
and down in silent communion, and sometimes
furtively touching hands&mdash;a young married pair,
I thought, before their first separation.
</p>
<p>We were off without much delay, a train-load
wholly of men, and all greenhorns. For
all of us had nice fresh crinkly blouses, and olive-drab
(properly o. d.) knees not yet worn white
(as I have seen on returning Plattsburgers)
while our canvas leggings were still unshaped
to our manly calves. Our hats were new and
stiff, and their gaudy cords were bright. And we
were inquisitive of the life that was ahead of us,
readily making acquaintance in order to compare
our scraps of information. Dismay ran here and
there with the knowledge that the typhoid inoculation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
required three weekly doses. Thank
goodness, that is over with for me. We tried to
be very soldierly in bearing, evidently an effort
in other cases than mine. One fellow had his own
gun along; he wanted, he said, to make a good
score on the range. So I had my first chance to
handle an army rifle.
</p>
<p>You know that when I left, you had been worrying
as to how I should stand the strain of the
coming month&#8217;s work. I will admit that I have
been wondering about it myself. I have worked
very hard for the last few years, practically without
vacation, in order to marry as suited Vera&#8217;s
ideas. And then, two years after she had said
Yes, and when my earnings ought to satisfy any
woman, began the complex strain of the breaking
of the engagement&mdash;the heart burnings, the self-searching,
the difficult coming to an understanding.
And now that she and I have parted friends,
with both of us quite satisfied, I have been realizing
how much run down I am, so that it has seemed
quite possible that Plattsburg life might be too
strenuous for me. But a good look at my companions
has made it clear that I can stand up
with the average of them. A fair number of
them, to be sure, are brown and seasoned by the
summer. But quite as many are pale and stooped
from desk work, or pasty from good living. If I
fall out, I shall have plenty of company.
</p>
<p>I write this letter while the train is approaching
Plattsburg. When I woke this morning we were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
at a standstill in some railway yard, and beside
us was standing another train, labelled like ours,
doubtless carrying the New York men. It drew
out ahead of us, and I suppose its inmates are
now debarked, and gawking about them as presently
my companions and I shall gawk. Tonight
I shall write again. Affectionately

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mama</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>It is unlucky that both of our cars were out of
order just when I was starting for Plattsburg.
For the train has been very hot and stufy, and
so crowded. I tried once more to get myself a
statroom, but when the agent said I should have
to be with three other men, then I just gave up,
and got the porter to make up my upper birth
early, and climbed into it though I wasn&#8217;t sleepy
at all. But it was something to get by myself
and be a little privat.
</p>
<p>I spoke to a few of the fellows, but I couldn&#8217;t
make much out of them. One had never been to
college, and another knew nothing of automobiles,
and another began talking about the drill regulations,
but you know I never even bought the
book. The whole train was one big smoking car,
and some fellows near me were very noisy over a
game of poker.
</p>
<p>I suppose I shall mannage to get along with
these fellows, because I know I must if I want
what father promised me, and if the fellows at
the Casino aren&#8217;t to laugh at me. But so far as
I can see, everyone on the train isn&#8217;t at all my
kind. Father doesn&#8217;t understand how I feel
about fellows who are not in our set. I don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
look down on them, you know, for I&#8217;m sure most
of them are very nice fellows of their sort. But
I never knew anyone of their kind before, and
what am I to talk to them about? Its all very
well for father to say that I can get something
worth while from every man I meet; but he&#8217;s a
business man, and so he&#8217;s used to them.
</p>
<p>You mustn&#8217;t think I&#8217;m unhappy if I say I shall
miss you and shall hate to be confined by the
camp regulations. I&#8217;m not going to back out for
father and cousin Walt have put it up to me to
see the thing through and though I&#8217;m kind of
used to disapointing father I don&#8217;t intend that
Walt shall think I&#8217;m sandless.
</p>
<p>But when the camp breaks up you must be
sure to be here, with the Rolls-Royce, to take me
home. I don&#8217;t think I could stand another trip
like this. Love from,

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>I had scarcely finished my letter of this morning
when the train began to slow down, and then
drew up alongside a wide and gently sloping
field, while on the other side was the lake. With
our luggage we poured out into the field, evidently
our training ground, since beyond it were tented
streets, with some big open-sided buildings that
doubtless had some military use, since we saw
rookies going in and out. In haste to get our
share of what was to be had, we consulted the
printed slips handed to us in the train.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On arriving at camp: First, Carry your hand
baggage to the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Where was the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A.? There was no
building standing near of even so much as two
stories. There were tents and there were shacks,
but even when we came to a street busy with
electrics, automobiles, motor trucks, and foot
passers, nothing of any size was to be seen. But
as I followed along with the rest, noting that
almost everybody we met, from the riders in the
autos to the drivers of the trucks, was military,
I saw a skeleton structure, tar-paper-roofed, and
bearing the magic letters for which we were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
looking. There regulars&mdash;artillerymen with red-corded
hats&mdash;received our bags through the open
frontage and stored them alphabetically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Second. Go to the mess-shacks for breakfast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We went. We breakfasted. The mess shacks
were those other open-sided buildings on the
drill-field which I had already seen; their construction,
being merely tarred roofs on posts and
walled with mosquito netting, promised no elegance
of fare. Nor was the fare elegant: milk,
coffee, cereal, hard boiled eggs, bread, butter, a
bruised apple. The milk was of two kinds, real
and canned. Used in the coffee, or with sugar
on the cereal, the canned milk was good enough
as poured from a hole punched in the container;
but a wise man near me prophesied that I should
not like to drink it when diluted. Flat, he said.
Tasted like chalk. Doubtless it was chemically
correct, but (you see how scientific he was) the
metabolism of the body despises chemical synthesis,
and for real nourishment the palate must
be satisfied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Third. At once after breakfast go to the
Adjutant&#8217;s Office and enroll.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So we stood in line, and when on nearing the
window of the office I heard the Adjutant say to
a predecessor, &#8220;Where&#8217;s your thirty dollars?&#8221; I
got out my greenbacks and presently paid them
in, twenty-five for our maintenance at camp, five
to be returned if during our stay we had not
damaged any of Uncle Sam&#8217;s property. And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
since the adjutant assigned me to a company, I
began to feel that I was getting somewhere.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fourth. Exchange your baggage checks for
camp claim checks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>None of that for me. I had known enough to
bring but a large suit-case, leaving behind everything
that I could persuade myself was unnecessary.
There was a memorandum on the printed
slip to the effect that trunks and other large
pieces of baggage would be stored at the post
barracks, where owners could visit them on Sunday
mornings. A sad weekly ceremony for one
who had to choose from an excess of luxuries!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifth. Report to the officer commanding
your Company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I did not find him. Though again I stood in
line, this time with men with whom I was to associate,
those to whom I reported in the Orderly
Tent at the head of H company street were but
sergeants and volunteers like myself, though men
of more experience, as I could tell by their weathered
uniforms and faded hat-cords. They filled
out a card concerning me, led me to the tent
pole, and measuring my height with a crude but
effective instrument, announced &#8220;Tent Eight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sixth. Bring your hand baggage to your
tent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So I brought it from the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. Now the
topography of the camp is thus. Just within the
enclosure, and parallel with the street outside,
runs the officers&#8217; street, their tents along one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
side of it, each with its little sign bearing the occupant&#8217;s
name. From the other side, toward
the drill ground and the lake, lead away the company
streets with double rows of khaki tents
facing each other. All were on a thin and barren
soil, where between the tents some few weeds
straggled, while everywhere else men&#8217;s feet had
killed all growth. No! For in front of one of
the tents, under the protection of its ropes, grew
a half-dozen thrifty pansy plants, all in bright
bloom. But elsewhere all was brown sand that
looked as if it might blow dust in clouds, but
which also, I was glad to see, looked as if it might
absorb all ordinary rains. The street, about
midway of its length, rose a little, then dropped,
and straddling this ridge I found Tent 8, in the
best possible position should the weather turn
wet. As I entered, stooping, I peered about the
shadowed interior.
</p>
<p>The dry floor was ploughed into holes and
ridges by the feet of the last occupants. One
man, bearded and grizzled, was sitting on a cot in
one corner, exploring the interior of a big blue canvas
bag; a professor or doctor person, who gave
me one keen glance, briefly said &#8220;Good day,&#8221;
and went on with his occupation. A second bed,
already neatly set up and equipped, stood in
another corner. Its owner, lithe and keen, a fellow
of about twenty-five, was watching a third,
man-sized but boy-faced, who was struggling with
a cot in its chrysalis stage, being apparently
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
quite unable to unfold it. I knew the lad at a
glance, young David Ridgway Farnham 3d, whose
cousin Walter was in my class, to whom I was best
man, as you remember, some five years ago.
Now young David has been the laughing stock of
the family, spoiled with riches and an indulgent
mamma. Walter told me that many tutors, on
princely salaries, just managed to get him through
Harvard this year. And here he was at Plattsburg!
However, he couldn&#8217;t know me, so I disposed
my things in a corner.
</p>
<p>The lithe and keen person seemed lither and
keener at second glance. He was of a splendid
blond type, with flashing blue eyes; everything
about him was perfectly straight, his backbone,
his nose, his close-cropped fair hair, the thin-lipped
mouth, the drop of his chin, and even the
precipitous fall of his high cheek-bones. He had
not noticed me at all, so intent was he on the
struggles of young Farnham. A very efficient
person he seemed, and immediately proved it.
For Farnham, with that appealing helplessness
which I remember in him as a charming child
(you know that with his brown eyes, curly hair,
and rosy skin he&#8217;s as handsome as a girl) looked
up at his watcher. He immediately said: &#8220;Bend
the leg the other way. Now the next one. Now
spread the whole thing out. Now spring those
two cross-pieces into place.&#8221; But even then,
though the cot had gained a recognizable shape,
Farnham was still baffled. His hands were soft,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
and so were his muscles. &#8220;This way,&#8221; said the
other after a moment. And sitting on the cot,
with his feet he forced the cross-bar at one end
into position, then swung about and put the
other one into place, and the thing was done.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said young David, politely but not
warmly, in a way that showed how used he is to
being waited on. &#8220;Have a cigarette? I suppose
we shall&mdash;er&mdash;room together. My name is
Farnham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mine is Knudsen,&#8221; said the other. And
then I appreciated the cause of his blondness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m from Harvard, class of &#8217;sixteen,&#8221; said
young David. Well-grown as he is, I couldn&#8217;t
help thinking of him as young.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m from Buffalo,&#8221; said Knudsen shortly. &#8220;I
run a foundry there.&#8221; His blue eyes were unwavering
and quite expressionless as he looked
Farnham over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Farnham? Farnham?&#8221; said the man with
the short pointed beard. The others turned and
looked at him. &#8220;I remember now. You were in
my section in English A, your Freshman year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said young David. &#8220;Professor Corder.
Of course. How de do? I remember that you
flunked me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you got through English D after two
tries,&#8221; said Corder. &#8220;Such is college life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As none followed up the subject, I asked where
they got their equipment. On their direction I
went to the store-tent at the head of the street,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
where on the strength of my signature an obliging
regular intrusted to me various listed articles,
which I lugged to the tent.
</p>
<p>This domicile is in the shape of a pyramid on a
three foot wall, about sixteen feet on a side, the
whole supported by a solid post held by an iron
tripod. The tent contains eight beds, the corporal&#8217;s
always to the right of the entrance, the
others in a mystic order which I will not bother
you with. As yet we did not know how we were
to fall in, but I set up my cot modestly among the
rear rank, put under it my suit case, laid on the
cot a mattress and pillow, properly cased in light
duck, and garnished the whole with three blue
blankets which promise comfort in this September
weather. And then I dove into the blue
bag.
</p>
<p>First on the list, a sweater, o. d., like all the
outfit, and very heavy.
</p>
<p>A poncho. A rubber oblong with button-holes
along three sides, and a slit, provided with a
collar, less than halfway down the middle.
</p>
<p>A shelter-half. That was the strangely shaped
piece of brown duck, in pattern something like a
big old-fashioned kite, with unsymmetrical button-holes
and loops of rope.
</p>
<p>Five tent-pins. Aluminum, ridged and bent.
</p>
<p>A pack. A queerly outlined piece of canvas,
provided with straps of webbing, wider or narrower,
with buckles, rings, and a big pocket.
Its attachments numerous and incomprehensible.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>A cartridge belt. Easily recognized, with its
many pockets and numberless eyelets.
</p>
<p>A first-aid kit. In a sealed tin box, buttoned
in a pocket attached to the belt.
</p>
<p>A canteen in a cloth case. Not flat and circular,
but solid and bulky.
</p>
<p>A bacon tin. Hm&mdash;a small box?
</p>
<p>A condiment can. A double ended contraption,
in one end of which had once been powdered
chocolate.
</p>
<p>A meat can. An oval sauce-pan, with a lid over
which the hinged handle shuts down.
</p>
<p>A knife, fork, and spoon.
</p>
<p>I stuffed them away again, shed my blouse, as
I saw the others were doing, and was therefore
ready when, our squad having filled up, the call
came for us to fall in. Out into the street we
tumbled, each of the dozen and a half tents
furnishing a squad, the squads falling in according
to number. The sergeants formed us, got us
into column of squads, and marched us away
down the public street, where military persons
of all kinds went by, from lone privates to officers
driving automobiles, and where the only notice
taken of us was by civilians in motor-parties, who
came to see our zoo.
</p>
<p>So here I was, for the first time in my life
marching in the ranks, like any private not knowing
where or why. For a quarter, a half, three
quarters of a mile we went at a quick pace on the
macadam, till my soft tissues knew what was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
meant by the &#8220;hammer, hammer, hammer on
the hard highway.&#8221; And my misery had plenty
of company. The man in front of me, a bulky
person, was wringing wet, and I saw another
fellow with the sweat actually dripping off his
chin. It was a welcome relief to turn in at a
big gate, pass between brick buildings, and come
onto a great grass field across which we marched
directly toward a building with a long portico, on
which the sight of rookies waiting promised us
rest. Very willingly we broke ranks at command.
We learned from our predecessors that we were
there for physical examination.
</p>
<p>When our turn came at last it was all very
brisk and business-like, and soon I was passed as
being sound in body and feet. With most of us
the ordeal was equally successful; but one poor
chap sat melancholy in a blanket, waiting for a
second test. Then I straggled back to camp with
Professor Corder, who confessed himself just
under the age-limit of forty-five. In spite of his
successful examination he acknowledged a little
anxiety as to whether he could stand the work;
has coddled himself, he acknowledges, for years;
worries about the effect of woollen stockings: I
imagine that most men of his age here have some
such anxiety.
</p>
<p>When enough of us had dribbled back to camp
we were again assembled, and were taken down
to the drill-field by the sergeant. And there for
the first time in my life I saw a West Pointer at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
his work. He appeared from somewhere, and the
sergeant handed us over to him. A tall and
lithe fellow he is, so graceful that not even his
military carriage can disguise it. He has an
olive-dark skin, hair that curls at the temples,
black eyes, nose straight and thin, and lips curving
like a woman&#8217;s. Give him the drooping
mustache of older days, and what a romantic
figure he would make! I knew him at once for a
Southerner, from his coloring, his physical beauty,
and a slight trace of languor, real or affected.
</p>
<p>But he knew his business. There is an uncertainty
about the sergeants, as thinking &#8220;Am I
doing this right?&#8221; But though he looked at us
out of eyes that were a little sleepy his tenor was
clear as a silver bugle, and (if you can excuse the
mixture of similes) it snapped like a whip. No
hesitation, nor even any thought as to what he
should do next. We straightened at the first
command he flung at us, and in three minutes we
were working to please him. The position of a
soldier! Was there the slightest spark of amusement
in his eyes as he described it to us, as if to
say &#8220;You mob of clerks and manufacturers and
professional men can&#8217;t really take this position&#8221;?
I never &#8220;lifted and arched&#8221; my chest so thoroughly.
Did he intimate as he gave his other
commands, &#8220;You men may play at doing this,
but really it takes a soldier to succeed&#8221;? If this
was his meaning, certainly it put us on our mettle.
What he gave us were the facings and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
steps and marchings, the simple movements by
fours, guiding and dressing. When we blundered,
there was his little concealed smile to make us
swear to do the thing right next time. As we
marched he kept pace with us, and then all his
languor was gone. His step was springy, his arms
swung, his eye roved up and down the line, and
he snapped out his &#8220;One, two, three, four!&#8221; each
like a little pistol shot. Remarked Corder, beside
me, &#8220;His time is absolutely perfect&mdash;do you
notice?&#8221; I had noticed. The sergeants tried to
imitate his counting, but compared to him they
were hoarse and spiritless.
</p>
<p>And he was only our lieutenant! The first
sergeant called him such, in answering a question;
and then I noticed the single bar on his collar.
What would the captain be like?
</p>
<p>The bugle blew Recall, and it was very welcome.
We were marched back to the company
street and dismissed. My rear rank man was one
Pickle, a hardware clerk from a town in central
Pennsylvania, who never in his life saw a big
league baseball game, and yet can tell you the
names and records of all the chief players, especially
of the Brooklyns, for which club he is a
rooter. He said of the lieutenant: &#8220;One of those
wiry wonders, Tireless Thomas of the Training-field.
Doesn&#8217;t he never remember that we are
flesh and blood? Me for my little cot!&#8221; Following
his example, more than half of the squad lay
down till roused by the news that our rifles were
being served out. So we flocked out in haste to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
get what would give us lamed shoulders and
tired arms. Being thus roused, I next went for a
swim in the lake, which was stony and cold and
altogether invigorating.
</p>
<p>The lieutenant had us out again in the afternoon,
us and the guns. Consequently we were
put through the manual of arms until the anticipated
lameness is now a reality, not only of
the arms but of the whole body. I find it is not
enough to shift your rifle according to prescribed
motions; it must be snappy, and in cadence.
&#8220;Like a clock-work,&#8221; muttered Pickle in despair.
And it is a crime to drop a rifle. Its first commission
roused our lieutenant from his languor.
&#8220;Who dropped that piece?&#8221; he thundered.
Then he outpoured contempt. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be glue
on little Willie&#8217;s fingers next time, sure,&#8221; whispered
Pickle.
</p>
<p>Tired at the end of the day, I yet feel virtuous,
having devoted to my country a pound of my
flesh. I write by lantern light in the tent, there
having been no conference tonight on account of
rain. Most of the squad are away, exploring the
city; but Corder is already abed and sleeping&mdash;
&#8220;as insurance,&#8221; he said to me, explaining his
middle-aged caution. I shall follow him soon.
Good-night from
</p>

<div class='ce' style=' font-style:italic;'>
<p>Postscript, written Saturday morning at 5.30, waiting for</p>
<p>breakfast.</p>
</div>

<p>We have in our squad one Randall, a person
of recent Yale extraction&mdash;though (having good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
Yale friends) I don&#8217;t lay it up against the college.
Yesterday he established his bed in the corporal&#8217;s
place, which so far the rest of us had modestly
avoided; and he fell foul of young David ten
minutes after he had come among us. The two
are evidently the youngest of us, with &#8220;college&#8221;
sticking out all over them, and so might naturally
draw together. But there is a still more natural
antagonism between them, of the thoroughbred
for the mongrel. For young Farnham, in spite
of his effeminacy, has the instincts of his ancestors;
and Randall, in spite of a magnificent
physique, carries round with him something that
says to David, &#8220;Don&#8217;t trust him!&#8221; What makes
personality? I declare I cannot put my finger
on the thing that makes me sure that Randall
is yellow; but David has seen it, and has drawn
back from it. Ninety-nine Yale men may slang
Harvard, and the Harvard man will take it in
good part&mdash;and <i>vice-versa</i>; but Randall is the
hundredth, and he said a few things that made
David tremble, not with anger but with disgust.
&#8220;Have a cigarette?&#8221; asked Randall at the end.
&#8220;No, thanks,&#8221; answered David.&mdash;&#8220;Oh, he doesn&#8217;t
smoke!&#8221; cried the other. &#8220;I do,&#8221; said David,
and lit his own cigarette. I&#8217;m sorry for it. Probably
Randall can make David pay for this declaration
of war. Yet I&#8217;m glad too. And you should
have seen Knudsen&#8217;s eye flash, and then soften
as he looked at the young fellow.
</p>
<p>War has been continuing these last few minutes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
In the most ridiculous way David, after his
shower bath, messed round with a shaving brush
and a piece of soap, trying to get a lather on his
face. Randall saw it first, and with roars of
laughter called our attention to him. Corder,
who instantly understood, quietly twinkled; but
Knudsen wrinkled his brow at the boy. &#8220;Have
you never done that before?&#8221; he demanded.
Said innocent David, &#8220;I forgot to get my man
to show me.&#8221; &#8220;Your <i>man</i>?&#8221; asked Knudsen.
&#8220;His valet!&#8221; screamed Randall, overcome with
the humor of the situation. Knudsen, never
having been acquainted with the Harvard Gold
Coast, showed in his keenly intelligent face first
amazement, then disgust, then to my pleasure a
kind of pity. In a moment he had both brush and
soap in his hands, and soon plentifully lathered
David. The boy then took his razor, one of the
old style, and immediately gashed himself.
</p>
<p>With indulgent impatience Knudsen took the
razor, sat the boy down, and muttering to himself
that he&#8217;d never tried this job before, skilfully
shaved one half of David&#8217;s face, at each moment
explaining the use of the weapon. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t
you get a safety razor?&#8221; he demanded. The lad
answered, &#8220;My cousin Walter uses this kind.&#8221; I
remember that he used to idolize Walt, as all the
younger fellows did; if he still has some of the
feeling there&#8217;s hope for him. Knudsen made him
shave the other half of his face himself&mdash;a botched
job, but still David finished it. Randall remarked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
that safety razors were best for girls, and when
David finally emerged fresh, pink, and handsome
in spite of his wounds, Randall said, &#8220;Now
you&#8217;re yourself again, Miss Lucy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s face is very sensitive; I saw that he
was more hurt than angry, and he flushed deeply
with the pain of it. It was Knudsen who was
angry, but he said nothing. Corder still watched
quizzically. I know that the title will stick. It
is not ten minutes since the word was uttered,
and we are already taking it up as David&#8217;s name.
Randall uses it flagrantly, the rest of us as a matter
of course, all except Knudsen. &#8220;Come on, Lucy,&#8221;
he said just now when the first call for assembly
sounded, and with his hand on David&#8217;s shoulder
he went with him into the street, protectively, I
think.
</p>
<p>I shall close this and send it off. Again love
from

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>My tremendous postscript of this morning has
somewhat led me out of the order of the day. I
found myself awake at reveille, and rolled willingly
out of bed. At the spigot, the one and only
article of convenience at the lower end of the
company street, I found a helpful comrade who
gladly soused me from a bucket, and the day
was begun. Back in the tent I found the fellows
slowly coming to consciousness, all except that
accurate and careful elder, Corder, who was dressing
with great preciseness after a shower bath,
and was calmly pleased at having no particular
symptoms of old age to report. He and I have
a valuable distinction as the only men in the
squad with foresight enough to have been <i>typhinated</i>,
worth while on this day when the others
must submit to inoculation, if they want to run
no risk on the hike. Then David&#8217;s shaving, as
described. It was cold when we finally turned
out, and our humane lieutenant, placing himself
on a table at the head of the street, while we in
open formation faced him, put us through setting-up
exercises that warmed us sufficiently to brave
the chilly mess-shacks for our breakfast.
</p>
<p>It was there that David found me out. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
first got my given name, Richard. Then he made
me acknowledge that I was in Harvard, 1910.
At the next pause he said, &#8220;My cousin Walter
Farnham was in that class.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said I,
and talked to the man on my other side. That
stumped David, that anyone should know his
cousin Walt and not be eager to talk about him.
He did not approach the subject again till he and
Knudsen and I and Corder were together in the
tent. Then he put it right up to me. &#8220;Weren&#8217;t
you my cousin&#8217;s best man?&#8221; &#8220;I was,&#8221; said I,
and Sick Call having just blown, I went out,
saying that I wanted to see who answered it. I
know Knudsen and Corder looked at me hard;
as for David, he cried out, &#8220;Oh, I beg your pardon!&#8221;
I have reasoned out that with his delicate
social perceptions and the stock of gossip that his
mother supplies him with, he must have concluded
that I was not in the mood to talk of weddings;
but the real fact is that I don&#8217;t intend to be enlisted
as his nurse. As for the other side of it, I
know I can depend on him not to tell the others
about Vera and me.
</p>
<p>When I came back, it being about time for drill,
I found him explaining that while of course he&#8217;d
not had his &#8220;man&#8221; at college, he always used a
barber there. The man, I&#8217;m sure, was with him
at all other times. Then when we fell in I heard
a fellow from another squad call David Lucy.
That was Randall&#8217;s doing. Presently it will be
all up and down the street. But Randall will be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
the only one to have any feeling about it. With
the others now it is a matter of course, even with
David himself.
</p>
<p>Our morning&#8217;s work began on the drill-field,
with its open drainage trenches yawning for our
feet and its scattered mounds to stumble on.
Gay work, this learning to walk in the right
place, stand in the right way, toss your nine
pound rifle about as if it were a straw, and all
with but a moment or two for thought between
the first order and the second. Even Pickle was
silent this morning, intent like the rest of us on
his job. We are all so green that, except for the
occasional old-timer, no one was giving his neighbor
any advice.
</p>
<p>Then on a sudden we were tested. &#8220;All who
have had any previous experience&#8221; were required
to step one pace to the front. There were not
many of them. Then &#8220;all who wish to be corporal,&#8221;
or words to that effect. With about half
the company I took the forward pace. The lieutenant
separated these goats from the humbler
sheep, sent us under a sergeant to another part of
the field, and himself took charge of the remainder.
The sergeant divided us up into twos and set us
by turns to drilling each other, evidently to test
our knowledge and our ability to give commands.
</p>
<p>Pickle was my victim, or I was his. We eyed
each other doubtfully. &#8220;You begin,&#8221; said I.
&#8220;No, you,&#8221; retorted he. &#8220;Gee, what a gink I was
to think I wanted to be corporal!&#8221; So I tackled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
the job; and of course, not being used to it, I made
long pauses between the commands, gave them
wrong, could not assume a proper military accent.
It&#8217;s not so easy. I have heard, in the armory
at Boston, a militia captain (<i>captain</i>, mind
you!) give the command &#8220;Attention!&#8221; in three
different ways, continually experimenting. So
how could I, for the first time in my life, rap out
my orders like a veteran? What we had to do
was absurdly simple; but poor Pickle, when I
balked, succeeded no better than I, so finally we
fell to consulting each other about it and became
idle, like other groups that we saw. Then came
our way another pair, who being as experienced
as we are green, speedily took us in charge and
manhandled us almost as skilfully as the lieutenant.
I presently saw our West Pointer observing
the drilling groups, and with him another
with two bars on his collar, the same erectness,
and the same natural air of knowing his business.
The two were like farmers judging cattle, disposing
of each one with swiftness, taking rapid
notes, and then herding us together into our
original ranks for a final shaking down. The
captain disappeared, but I hoped he was to be
ours, for though I had had but sidewise glimpses
of him, there seemed a fine frank openness about
him that I liked.
</p>
<p>Sure enough, in the afternoon he appeared
in this wise. The company was assembled and
marched out onto the highway, where we stood
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
in double rank with our hats off, for a final sizing
up. I heard a new voice, deep and powerful, at
the further end of the line; then along he came
with the lieutenant, rapidly sizing us up, counting
us off, thrusting in a new man here and there,
the new men to be our corporals. Randall disappeared
into another squad, and we have now
as corporal one of those two who drilled Pickle
and me this morning. There are these others
of us: Pickle, Corder, Knudsen, Lucy, Clay, a
handsome young Southern medical student, and
Reardon, a grocer&#8217;s clerk from a little town in
Connecticut. Our corporal is Bannister, manager
of the routing department, whatever that may
be, of a tool-making establishment near Detroit.
For a mixed crowd, of ages from grizzled Corder
down to the very new graduate, what could be
better? The captain, having put us all in place,
called us to attention without any fuss, and
stated that the new Number Four men were to
be our squad leaders &#8220;until such time as other
men proved themselves to be better.&mdash;So go to
it,&#8221; he added grimly. Then he marched us back
to the street, where the tents were all freshly
numbered with chalk, and dismissed us to put
our beds in the proper order.
</p>
<p>Since military regulations cover the positions
of beds in the tent, almost every man had to shift
his place. A genius discovered that this was a
good time to begin with a level floor, the idea ran
rapidly from squad to squad, and presently the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
street was filled with piled cots and heaped baggage,
while from each door came clouds of dust.
Our floor levelled, taking care to preserve the
pitch of the ridge that runs through it, we moved
in again, even before the dust was settled. As I
am Number One of our front rank, I bunk to the
left of the door; peer around the opening, and
you will see my feet. Our rifles and bayonets we
keep in a gun rack that leans against the tripod
of the tent-pole; and our surplus clothes we hang
from a square frame that is suspended higher
up. These two conveniences are squad property,
being bought at a dollar each from a Jewish-looking
gentleman who offered them for sale,
their evident usefulness forcing the bargain. As
they are most roughly built of light lumber, and
have plainly served in each of the previous camps
this year, there is good profit to the speculators
who supplied them in the first place, and who
gather them up when they are abandoned at the
breaking up of each camp, only to sell them
again. The tax on the squad is not great, but I
wonder why the camp management allows outsiders
such princely takings.
</p>
<p>Feeling energetic, I began digging out the old
ditch that surrounds our tent, to make it better
able to carry off water in the next storm. Knudsen
insisted on doing his share, then Corder took
the spade from him for the next side. When
Pickle, who was standing ready, said &#8220;<i>You</i> don&#8217;t
need to work,&#8221; Corder asked plaintively, &#8220;Do
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
I seem as old as that?&#8221; So he was allowed to do
his stint. Lucy placidly watched us.
</p>
<p>Then, it being yet early afternoon, the typhoid
candidates, more than half the company, were
gathered up and taken away to be punctured.
The small remainder of us were taken to the drill
field and were delivered to the sergeants, apparently
that they might show their mettle in the
presence of the officers. Now you know that
every calling has its tests of a man; in this soldier
business the first lies in the ability to stand up
and give your orders with such confidence in
yourself that your men shall feel confidence in
you. There were two of the sergeants that I
noticed for their difference in this respect. The
one was sunburned, tall, and lean; his brows
jutted, his eyes under them were steady and
sharp, his shoulders were square, and he had a
very firm pair of bow-legs, which in some men
is not displeasing. He knew his job; his voice
rolled like the deep notes of an organ; we knew
what he meant for us to do, and we did it. The
other man was narrow and chicken-breasted, his
long legs weak, his smile a smirk, his pronunciation
so affected that we disgraced him because
we blundered from pure lack of comprehension.
Why is it that men&#8217;s outsides so often correspond
to their innards? And how did the latter of these
two get his job? I suppose he has done some
service to warrant his sergeant&#8217;s stripes.
</p>
<p>Corder and I went to the lake to swim. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
interests me by the careful study of his condition;
is afraid that some sign of old age will develop
to send him away, and is almost boyishly pleased
to find himself able to do all the work. &#8220;And I
hope,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that I shall learn to stand
straighter. One feels a certain pride when in
uniform, and I try to fill mine out, if only to escape
hearing some youngster say, &#8216;Gee, get onto that
hollow-chested professor chap as a rookie!&#8217; But
it&#8217;s hard to keep straight.&#8221; The prime of life, he
said to me again, isn&#8217;t so very prime.
</p>
<p>When we came back the street was full of invalids.
Army serum must work quick, for half
the arms of the inoculees were lame, and when
I thoughtlessly touched Pickle on the shoulder
he howled. &#8220;The guy that counted out my half
billion bugs,&#8221; said he, &#8220;must have thrown in an
extra hundred thousand for good measure. And
they&#8217;re all working overtime.&#8221; At Retreat there
was some difficulty in coaxing arms into blouses,
and a number of men asked to be excused from
evening duties for the sole purpose of lying upon
their couches and staring at the canvas.
</p>
<p>The rest of us marched to our first conference,
on the slope of the drill field below the furthest
mess-shacks, where we were massed in a semi-circle.
It was an interesting sight, a thousand
men in olive-drab slowly blending with their background
as the dusk grew, yet with the faces of
most of them showing up in the coming moonlight.
Behind the speaker were the lake and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
mountains, with the moon just beginning to
glimmer on the little waves. It was the General
himself who addressed us, welcoming us, speaking
briefly of the purpose of our coming, expressing
confidence that we would work as hard as our
predecessors: a fine man-to-man address. I could
not help thinking of a German general that I
once heard speak to <i>Einjaehriger</i>&mdash;stiff, short,
and unapproachable. Wood was stimulating, and
made us readier for our duties.
</p>
<p>The moon was brighter when we got back to
the company street, and someone had lighted a
fire at its head. Here a hundred of us, including
some of the invalids, packed together in a circle
around our new captain, while he spoke to us
briefly. I had a good view of him. Shorter than
the lieutenant, yet still a tall man, very strongly
made, he spoke, like the general, as man to man,
and the least thing he appeared to expect was any
difficulty with us. He told us that the work was
hard and tiresome; he would make it as easy as
possible, but he knew we were there to work, and
we could depend on him (without a twinkle) to
give us everything that was coming to us. His
tent was right at the head of the street; he wanted
us to come to him at any time for any question;
it was his business (and again no twinkle) to
make our minds as well as our bodies comfortable.
Thus I get the impression that he is something of
a humorist, yet also that his chief trait is aggressiveness.
I cannot tell you why, for all was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
spoken with a quiet voice, even with a certain
gentleness that disguises what I am sure is the
basic character of the man. Knudsen felt it too,
for as we walked away from the conference he
said: &#8220;The captain&#8217;s a scrapper.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a Southerner,&#8221; said Clay with satisfaction.
It had been plain in his accent.
</p>
<p>This letter, begun Saturday night, I finish
Sunday morning. Send me, please, a dozen
clothes pins, to keep my washing on the tent-ropes.
Pickle hung up his wet towel today, and
had to chase it into the next company street.
As everywhere is the same black sand, you can
imagine its condition, likewise that of a moist
cake of soap when you accidentally drop it&mdash;excellent
for scouring, but not good for other
cleaning purposes until its new covering is dissolved
away. Send me also some paper napkins
folded; the supply at the mess-shacks sometimes
gives out.
</p>
<p>A bit of character. Lucy was looking this
morning rather helplessly at his silk pajamas,
and wondering where he could get them washed,
when there entered the tent a handsome and
stalwart regular. &#8220;Washing?&#8221; he inquired respectfully.
&#8220;Oh,&#8221; asked Lucy hopefully, &#8220;are
you an agent for some laundress?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; said
the man, &#8220;I wash them myself. I guarantee
to return everything tomorrow, properly done.&#8221;
The boy was not merely surprised, but almost
shocked. &#8220;<i>You</i> do the work?&#8221; he asked. Then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
his native kindness came to his aid, and he was
about to bundle all his clothes into the fellow&#8217;s
hands, when Knudsen said, quietly but very
pointedly, &#8220;When I&#8217;m here at camp I wash my
own clothes.&#8221; David flushed quite pink. &#8220;Then
I think I&#8217;ll do the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good for him,&#8221; said Knudsen to me afterward.
&#8220;It&#8217;s good for him to be called Lucy.
It&#8217;s good for him to learn to shave himself with
that razor. I was going to tell him to buy
himself a safety razor, but thought I&#8217;d better
not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad I left David to find his own nurse.
Knudsen manages him with certainty. On the
other hand the boy likes him immensely, even
though the taciturn Swede does but a small
share of the talking when they are together. He
is a foundryman, had a hard struggle to establish
his growing business, and has in consequence
a fierce outlook on the world, as one who at any
time may have to fight for his own. David,
by persistent but most tactful questioning, has
brought out two salient facts in his biography.
Knudsen is first the son of an immigrant, talks
Swedish in his home, has none of the American
background which to David is a man&#8217;s birthright.
And second he is a college man, from Hobart.
Over these two facts the boy is sadly perplexed.
Legally, Knudsen is as American as the rest of us&mdash;but
can he be? Socially he is also all right,
since he is a college man&mdash;but after all can you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
call Hobart a college? Don&#8217;t blame David. It&#8217;s
not his fault if he&#8217;s narrow-minded.
</p>
<p>I shall close and mail this letter now, and at
the first convenient opportunity shall begin the
next. I foresee that my letters to you will be
practically a continuous performance. Love from

<p>Say, Tony, what a mutt I was not to get myself
jabbed for typhoid before I came here! It
would have been worth the money. Today my
arm feels like a hornet&#8217;s nest, with roots up into
my shoulder and down my ribs. And my head
is light and wavy&mdash;that&#8217;s fever. I saw one guy
keel over stiff when the doctor stuck him, and the
poor corp of our squad says he&#8217;d swap jobs with
his rear-rank man if he could only feel like a boy
again.
</p>
<p>They feed you here with food that&#8217;s like ourselves,
coarse and plentiful. I&#8217;ll never again call
sister&#8217;s doughnuts sinkers; wish I could see any
kind of a doughnut. The table china is delicate
French&mdash;nit. The waiters are in livery. The
man with a long reach will grow fat while others
starve. Take care not to spill anything; it may
fall into your hat that hangs under the table.
Iced tea should be iced and should be tea; milk
should be milk. When you see a thing that you
want, ask for it; the platter will get to you even
if the food don&#8217;t. Elbows on the table are comfort
but bad form, same as at home. The men that
stay longest at table take pains to tell you that
they eat slow. Eat first whatever is handiest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
when you sit down; why be idle while your soup
is coming?
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s considered impolite to drink at the company
spigot, but there&#8217;s no rule against cleaning
your teeth there. The best way to rinse your
stocking after soaping is to hold it over the nozzle
like a bag, and squeeze it while the water runs
through. It takes so long to get hot water here
that you&#8217;d better learn to shave with cold. I
never before made my toilet out on the sidewalk,
but a fellow can get used to anything.
</p>
<p>You may talk of being chambermaid to a cow,
but it&#8217;s worse being groom to a gun. These
rifles have been in use all summer, and they&#8217;re
all et up inside. They&#8217;re like fat men, they sweat.
Then they rust. Put in some dope and swab the
barrel, then take twenty-five dinky little squares
of cotton flannel and run them through, and the
last will be just as dirty as the first. Let it go
at that, and put in some oil, and say Damn.
</p>
<p>It takes three lacings below the knee to get
yourself dressed, and three unlacings to get to
bed, unless you want to be a real soldier boy,
and sleep in your clothes. And only two hooks in
all these lacings&mdash;the rest eyelets, eyelets. The
cartridge belt has ten pockets; I found a clip of
blanks in mine, and am keeping it to celebrate
with. The proper way to draw your bayonet is
not to cut your ear off. They tell me it&#8217;s been
done. The outfitter lied to me. He sold me a
tight blouse because we wore our sweaters over
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
them, and here it&#8217;s against the rule and my
sweater will never go under the blouse and I&#8217;ll
freeze to death. Never believe anybody that
says he knows.
</p>
<p>When the horn blows pay no attention. It&#8217;s
the top sergeant&#8217;s whistle you&#8217;ve got to jump for.
If you want to know what to wear don&#8217;t ask him;
the lieutenant will change the order and the captain
will change it again. Ask the major, unless
the general happens by. Always salute unless
you happen to be smoking; if you have a pipe in
your mouth, don&#8217;t see him. Fall River!

<h2><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Private Richard Godwin to His Mother</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><i>Sunday evening, Sep. 10th, 1916.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;-
</p>
<p>I had no sooner closed this morning&#8217;s addenda
than I had to prepare for the bugaboo of tent
inspection. A good bugaboo, of course, as at
home it always pays to have visitors, we redd up
the house so carefully. Our job this morning
was not only to have the tent perfectly neat,
but also to have our kits laid out on our beds
according to regulations. One blanket was
spread over the cot, the others were folded at
the head, and on them the sweater and pillow.
At the foot were folded the poncho and shelter
half; then all the equipment was spread out.
Under the head of the bed was the blue barrack-bag
and the suit-case; under the foot the shoes.
Then we stood in line in front of the tent, and
watched while the lieutenant, coming from tent
to tent, left each squad in a state of despair behind
him. To cheer us, someone at the sergeants&#8217;
tent started a victrola, but a snap from
the lieutenant ended that diversion. Result of it
all: we were told to inspect a certain bed in Tent
One, fold our blankets and ponchos <i>right</i>, and lay
out our equipment according to a sacredly prescribed
order. A meek procession filed in and
out of the tent for the next half hour.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>It appears that blankets must be folded in a
certain manner and laid in a certain way, so that
the inspector can see at a glance whether the
proper number of them is present&mdash;that none are
in hock, I suppose. The manner of folding ingeniously
insures that on making the bed at
night the blankets must first be entirely shaken
out; ditto in the morning. Some sanitary martinet
evolved that scheme. We are told that a
fourth blanket will be served out to us. Folded
double lengthwise, four will allow seven thicknesses
over us and one below, or any other proportion,
according to the temperature. Sleeping
as I do with the tent wall looped up, I shall be
glad of the seven thicknesses.
</p>
<p>Cleanliness being next to godliness, many of
the men washed clothes instead of going to church.
A little daily washing in this fair weather keeps
a wardrobe always ready for service. It&#8217;s simple
if you combine your laundry work with your
swim.
</p>
<p>Bannister, our corporal, got us out on the drill
field this afternoon for squad practice. But as
even he is new to many of our evolutions, instead
of monarchy we found democracy, so many of us
had something to say. Part of the time Knudsen
gently but firmly managed the squad; we taught
each other how to stack arms; and finally from
one argument we could only be rescued by appeal
to the drill regulations. We knelt around the
little blue book, while the opponents of two apparently
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
conflicting ideas eagerly debated, until
of a sudden each saw the other&#8217;s point, and discovered
that they meant the same thing.
</p>
<p>Coming back, we found ourselves heading
obliquely toward the company street, with a half
turn to make in order to enter it properly. Corder
suggested that the command should be
&#8220;Left half turn,&#8221; but Reardon contended for
&#8220;Half left,&#8221; and at the proper moment the corporal
gave that order. Naturally there ensued
at the tent another debate, everyone putting in
his oar, until by the book the Old One proved
that while for a company in column the command
should have been &#8220;Column half left,&#8221; for a squad
&#8220;Left half turn&#8221; was correct. A mixing business,
this learning how to fight for one&#8217;s country.
</p>
<p>Said I to Corder, &#8220;You&#8217;ll take Bannister&#8217;s job
away from him if he doesn&#8217;t look out.&#8221; He
laughed. &#8220;No,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I like to admire the
scenery rather than attend to business, and I&#8217;m a
dreamer anyway. But watch Knudsen. He&#8217;s a
soldier type, and unless I&#8217;m mistaken he&#8217;s had
some training, though he doesn&#8217;t claim it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Word has gone forth that we are to go through
the drill regulations at the rate of some forty
paragraphs a day. So there is much study up
and down the street, and that not merely on the
part of would-be corporals.
</p>
<p>This letter is finished under difficulties, for the
lantern goes out every few minutes, as four of
us cluster around it with our pens and paper.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
A puff, a pop, a flicker or two, and it&#8217;s out.
Then laughter, curses, two or three failures to
light the wick, and we&#8217;re off again for another
short spell. Clay promises that we shall have no
trouble with the lantern after tonight. Some
squads have clubbed together to buy acetylene
lanterns, which illuminate the tents most brilliantly;
but the cost is seven dollars, and though
our squad has mentioned the luxury, it is evident
that most of the men wish to avoid the extra
expense. Though of course I could buy the thing
as a present to the squad, I think it would rather
mar our present feeling of equality. Moreover,
there was a trifle of an explosion in Tent 13 early
this evening, after which the new lantern was
thrown away as junk. If I should come again, I
should bring some compact lighting contraption.
Meanwhile the little flashlight is good for searching
in one&#8217;s suit case, and there is always a table and
electric light at the company tent, close by the
captain&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>Good-by, with love from

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>I began my day with my usual bucket from the
tap; there are always early birds to serve me, and
my helper this morning said it made him feel
virtuous just to souse me. I prefer this to the
shower baths, which are much further away. A
very few go early to the lake and make parade of
it; said one to his corporal yesterday, finding him
crawling from his bed into his clothes, &#8220;My God,
man, don&#8217;t you ever bathe?&#8221; But the poor corporal
was still shaking with his typhoid.
</p>
<p>Clay, who was up early on mysterious errands
in the dusk, has just brought in boards to lay in
front of his cot. Reardon asked, &#8220;What are you
going to do on the hike? You&#8217;ll have to put
your feet on the ground.&#8221; But Clay evidently
likes a bit of luxury, and when he gave me his
surplus boards I found I liked it too, for I prefer
keeping my feet out of this sand, which has a
creeping quality and gets everywhere. Out in
front of the tent there had appeared a bench.
&#8220;Hi!&#8221; cried Bannister, &#8220;where did that come
from?&#8221; Clay said nothing, and Bannister, who
appreciated the new convenience, thought it best
to ask no more. I, with a mind on further conveniences,
suggested that we club together for a
bucket for our washing. Clay offered to get this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
without cost, but late in the afternoon reported
failure. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get one, though I looked in
every tent in the other companies.&#8221; Then he
missed our new bench. &#8220;Where has it gone?&#8221;
he demanded. Corder answered dryly, &#8220;Back to
its original owners, I suppose.&#8221; But the lantern
works better tonight, as the fellows all remark,
avoiding mention of the fact that it has a somewhat
different shape.
</p>
<p>This morning we had our first drill in calisthenics.
We were spaced in very open order,
advised to take off our shirts, and Captain
Wheeler, a magnificent figure of a man, strong
as an oak in spite of his gray hair, stood on
a platform and put us through exercises that
searched out, so the boys agreed, muscles that
you didn&#8217;t know you had. You get a new idea
of the &#8220;position of a soldier&#8221; after he has shown
it to you. &#8220;Oh, no, no, no!&#8221; he cried when first
we came to attention at his command, his voice
rolling away over the lake into infinite distance.
And then he made us try to show that we were
proud of our uniforms.
</p>
<p>This afternoon&#8217;s platoon drill, under our lieutenant,
made me very sure that, though I already
feel as if I had been here for weeks, I am not yet
master of my work. The drill kept me thinking.
As it is no pleasure to be publicly called down, I
am all the while trying to make no mistakes. A
fellow must instantly&mdash;instantly!&mdash;know the difference
between &#8220;Platoon right,&#8221; for instance,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
and &#8220;Right by squads,&#8221; even though the commands
may not have been given for an hour.
And one must know it whether corporal or not,
for half the time the corporals do not yet know it
themselves, and either mumble their commands
or are silent, so that they are no help. And even
if a fellow knows what to do, but lags in the
doing of it, then he is likely to put the whole line
out. Further, freight trains rumble by at the
bottom of the drill field, the wind whistles in
your ears, other officers near at hand are shouting
commands to other platoons, and so you are
likely not to hear a command at all. But on the
whole I think I am improving.
</p>
<p>The short time that we had with the captain
was enough to prove that he is, as Clay claimed,
a Southerner, if only from his use of the word
<i>like</i>. As we came down from the right shoulder,
he said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t climb your rifle lahk it was a
rope.&#8221; And at Present Arms, &#8220;That man is
holding up his piece lahk it was a Christmas
tree.&#8221; &#8220;Swing your arms,&#8221; said he, &#8220;lahk you
were proud of yo&#8217;selves!&#8221; Other little localisms
slip in. When a man had explained a question
that the captain at first did not understand, he
said when he grasped it, &#8220;Oh, Ah see; Ah didn&#8217;t
locate yo&#8217;.&#8221; But it is a pity to misspell so broadly.
The differences of accent, though evident, are
slight and pleasing, even musical.

</p>
<p>You will want to know, now that I have shaken
down into this life, how on the whole it suits me.
I feel as if I had been here a fortnight, such being
the power of routine. You know I am among
perfect strangers, for though Nelson is in my company,
I see very little of him. We actually have
not looked each other up since Saturday. And
though Watson of the Philosophy department and
Jones of the Library staff are both here, they are
in other companies, and the best I have done is
to pay each of them a hurried call. The real life
is the life of the squad, and I find myself among
interesting fellows.
</p>
<p>The work is not too hard, for the officers give
us periods of rest, and we are gradually hardening
up. I live very cautiously, always change my
stockings and rest my feet whenever I come off
the drill-field, and whenever I can I lie down for a
nap. But I am getting so lively that I find myself
tempted to ignore these precautions, and hope
that before long I can take not only the work but
the fun as it comes. The excellent stockings which
you knit for me are not too heavy nor too hot;
you were wise to mark every thing that I wear,
as in this camp articles of clothing very much resemble

one another. My sewing kit, with all its
threaded needles, called out the wonder of the
corporal the other day, and the whole squad
stood around and admired it.
</p>
<p>I hope in time to attain a more military carriage,
but it is a hard fight with habit. I wish
I were as springy as these boys around me; even
as I work the fat out of my bacon, I don&#8217;t find
myself perfectly elastic. For I get a bit stiff in
the knees from long standing at the manual;
and as the evening chill comes on I find it gets
more into my joints than I like. And so I am
watching the development of a problem with
which I, that is, my mind, can have very little
to do. Question: shall I get stiffer as the days
grow colder, until on the hike they will discharge
me as an old man; or will it all work off as I get
used to the exercise, until I am limber? It is
really a very serious matter, my dear, this being
forty-five years old. One should turn life into
a profession, and study how to become young.
There are a number of men of my age or older
here at camp, and I find we all have this same
preoccupation, and very eagerly ask each other
how we are getting on, and give advice. And
the hike&mdash;that looms ahead of us all as an ordeal
which we are afraid we shan&#8217;t pass.
</p>
<p>I never tire of the view from our drill field.
The mountains are never twice the same, and the
lake is quite as changeable; they vary their aspect
every hour from morning to evening. We
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
are lucky just now in our full moon, to light us
about the unaccustomed streets. In contrast
are the ugly tents, which yet have a romantic
interest in their possible warlike use, and in their
perfect uniformity, which is so forbidding that it
becomes interesting. And for one who has come
from a skirted sea-side resort, it is not unpleasant
to see around me nothing but men, men, men.
</p>
<p>Your letters make me feel easy about the family.
We are very lucky that Mildred did not get
a bad fall when the handle of her bicycle broke.
Tell Florence to make a proper distinction between
<i>to</i> and <i>too</i>, and to form her capital Cs more
carefully. Little Elinor&#8217;s letters are much admired
in the whole tent. It must be about time
to pick the Gravenstein apples. Tell Robert to
handle them as if they were eggs.
</p>
<p>You see I am well. Do not worry about me.
Love to all the youngsters.

<h2><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Private Richard Godwin to His Mother</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><i>Plattsburg, Tuesday, September 12.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>Today we have had something new. We have
so far been drilling in close order formation, so
called because we always maintain our front
and rear ranks together as such. This order has
two purposes, one for parade and review, the
other for quickest marching to any given place.
But for fighting, which after all is our real purpose,
the close order must be discarded in favor
of extended order, which you will understand
better if I call it skirmish line formation. Here
front and rear rank form in one long line, in order
not to do damage to each other in firing.
</p>
<p>Our drill field at the camp distinctly has its
drawbacks. Across part of it are open drainage
ditches; and another part, where no ditches are,
is a slippery bog after any rain. Drilling on such
a field distracts you between the natural desire
to pick your footing, and the officers&#8217; constant
command to keep your eyes up. We are told
that the city of Plattsburg is very generous in
providing this ground, and doubtless it was to
begin with; yet I wonder if after two very prosperous
seasons, due to our presence and our visitors&#8217;,
the city couldn&#8217;t afford to put a few hundred
dollars (it would cost no more) into finishing draining
the field with tile, and filling the ditches in.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
That would give us good dry ground and firm
footing.
</p>
<p>At any rate, it was a relief to be marched this
morning to the military post, to practice our new
formations on its great smooth field. The parade-ground
is a wide level space by the edge of the
lake, and on the inner side is a long row of the
married officers&#8217; houses, all exactly alike, yet
with shrubs and vines not unhomelike. I saw
three children at one place, two at another, plus
two nursemaids; but as a whole the houses look
deserted, as they are. For all our regiments of
this department are on the Mexican border, and
while papa is away it is natural for mamma to
take the babies to visit grandpa, if indeed she
doesn&#8217;t go to the border too. As a consequence
of this absence of the infantry regiments, we are
ministered to here by some companies of coast
artillery, which are useless to the government in
this crisis, and so are unwillingly serving here
as cooks, waiters, and equipment orderlies. Our
officers are scraped up from everywhere, the captain
of my company even coming from Panama.
Unless they can persuade themselves that there
is to be no more fighting in Mexico, they must
hate to settle down here as mere missionaries of
the preparedness movement.
</p>
<p>Well, we were taken onto the field, and were
given our first dose of skirmish drill. The captain
explained how the squad should do the expanding
movement on which the whole is based.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
&#8220;Being at a halt,&#8221; as the regulations are fond of
saying, the corporal takes position three paces
in front of his Number Two man, extends his
arms as a signal or gives his order, and the
men at a run take given positions on a line with
him. A corporal and his squad being ordered to
illustrate this for the benefit of the rest of us, the
corporal forgot to stand fast, and so away the
eight of them went, heading directly for the lake,
the captain watching them with amusement, the
rest of us snickering. Over the edge of the bluff
they went, we heard crashes in the bushes, and
presently, when the rest of us were beginning
our demonstration, we saw the sheepish return
of our lost squad. No one in our company will
ever now forget that when we begin our deployment
at a halt, we advance those three paces and
no more.
</p>
<p>You see now the real value of the corporal.
He is of use in close order formation, yet there,
with a little drill, the company could get along
without him. But in extended order he is in
independent command of the squad, takes his
orders from his superior, translates them according
to circumstances, and separately leads his
little bunch of men to the place where they are
to deploy. Moreover, since his problem varies
according as we are marching or at a halt, in line
or in column, and according as we are to guide
centre, right, or left, the corporal needs (we
proved it today) to have a cool head and a firm
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
hold of his men. In one case we go forward, in
another we march to one side before deploying,
in still another we make a letter S, going backward
and then forward again. There was a wonderful
confusion this morning, with all of us greenhorns
trying to learn this new work. Moreover, since
we are volunteers, and men of intelligence, and
by this time pretty well acquainted, every man
of us thought he understood everything, and
was bursting to tell the others how it should be
done.
</p>
<p>And then began to appear which of our corporals
were corporals indeed. Some squads were
little Babels, each man uttering forth his voice,
with the poor squad-leader either vainly trying
to make himself heard, or silently trying to make
his own ideas square with the contradictions of
the other seven. Other squads may have been
repressed volcanoes, but still they were repressed,
with the corporal making his mistakes in his own
way, but learning by blundering how the thing
should be done. As for Squad 8, Knudsen was
guarding the corporal&#8217;s peace of mind. Once
when Bannister had mistaken the order, and I
burst out with a whispered &#8220;Too far!&#8221; Knudsen
snapped at me, &#8220;No speaking to the corporal!&#8221;
Now since once or twice he had given advice,
that was a touch too much; but I caught a significant
twinkle in Corder&#8217;s eye, and held my
peace. I shan&#8217;t soon forget the puzzled expression
on Bannister&#8217;s round, honest face when he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
found himself many yards out of the way, and
his involuntary &#8220;Whoa!&#8221; Then Knudsen quietly
took charge of us, and led us where we belonged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is going to be interesting,&#8221; whispered
Corder to me. &#8220;Remember what I told you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the afternoon, among other drill work, we
were taught how to make our packs. The
strangely shaped piece of webbing which I once
tried to describe to you, with all its straps and
hooks, is a haversack worked out by a commission
headed by a Major Stewart, who evolved
this Stewart pack, the lightest by many pounds of
any army pack in the world. Now give attention.
On the ground you spread your poncho, rubber
side downward. On it you lay your shelter-half and
fold it till it too is an oblong, smaller than the
poncho. Next you fold one blanket thrice and
lay it with its stripe lengthwise of the poncho.
Lay on it your tent-pegs, rope, bacon box and
condiment can, a change of underclothes, your
soap and razor, tooth-brush and towel. Lap
over it the edges of the poncho and the shelter-half.
Now roll this from the blanket end, packing
tightly; and when you approach the end of the
poncho, fold eight inches of it toward you, and
into this pocket work the roll. Thus you have
made a tight waterproof sausage, firmly enough
packed to be thrown about without coming open.
The first stage of making your pack is now finished.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>The roll is now, by means only to be learned by
actual doing, to be strapped to the haversack,
which also carries the bayonet and, in its big
pocket, the meat-can, knife, fork, and spoon.
The pack is next, by its complicated straps, attached
to the belt, and the whole is put on like
a vest, the arms through its broad straps. These
should be so tightened that the top of the pack
comes well above the level of the shoulders, so
that the straps will not drag and cut. The belt is
buckled in front, but should be loose enough to
hang over the hips. Thus the whole weight of
the pack and belt is carried by the shoulders,
which are braced back as by the old-fashioned
shoulder brace, leaving the chest free for expansion,
and carrying no weight.
</p>
<p>The pack weighs about eighteen pounds, the
belt (with full canteen and cartridge pockets)
another eight, the rifle nine. Thirty-five pounds,
for light marching order, is much less than any
other army than ours is blessed with. And this
outfit is to be, as our captain grimly remarked
today, our constant companions. Oh my poor
back!
</p>
<p>I know it will be hard to read this letter, my
hand shakes so. This is because all this morning
I carried my rifle &#8220;at trail,&#8221; which means that I
gripped it a foot from the muzzle and carried it
with the butt just off the ground, the butt constantly
exercising a heavy leverage on the wrist.
Naturally I am lame.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>Your letters come daily, which saves me much
anguish. At each distribution of the mail there
is much quiet disappointment, which later is
very likely to express itself in the tent. Said
Reardon today, the silent man of the squad,
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to write a letter home that will raise
hell.&#8221; Bannister, whose wife had missed a day,
remarked gravely, &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to say something
to her.&#8221; And Pickle came into the tent mad,
savagely remarking, &#8220;If I don&#8217;t get a letter next
mail, I&#8217;m going home.&#8221; Luckily it came.
</p>
<p>But yet the men don&#8217;t always sympathize with
each other. Clay was bitterly complaining of
his luck. Said Knudsen, &#8220;But man, you can&#8217;t
expect an answer to your letter yet. It had to
go to Maryland.&#8221; Then Bannister, taking his
mind from his own disappointment, added, &#8220;And
great Scott! look at the letter you writ. It was
so long that she would need three whole days to
read it in, before she could begin her answer.
And as to your writing such an amount to your
mother&mdash;!&#8221; &#8220;It was only eight pages,&#8221; said
handsome Clay, blushing. Bannister had no
mercy. &#8220;Only eight pages? Man, it was a
young novel! To your mother? Your grandmother,
more likely.&#8221; Clay was silenced.
</p>
<p>Our fourth blankets are served out, and we
sleep very snug. Food is the same, wholesome
but not delicate. David and Pickle, having each
a sweet tooth, buy rather freely outside, and
David occasionally slips away for a hotel meal.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
As a consequence, they sometimes need doctoring.
The rest of the squad, whether from economy
or on principle, stick to the daily mess and
are well. Love from

saw her here today. Am well. Love.

<div class='ce'>
<p><i>Second postscript, written in the margin</i></p>
</div>

<p>I find I have written you a letter that will
show you my difficulties in getting time to write.
It is merely typical of my usual day.
</p>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>I begin this letter in the tent at about 5.30 in
the morning, expecting the first assembly, yet
trying to snatch a little time while the rest of the
camp is still dressing. My hand no longer aches,
but the wrist is plain stiff from yesterday&#8217;s exercise
at trail. I have just conned over fifty paragraphs
of the drill book, getting up early for the
purpose.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>Free time is scarce. When the captain yesterday
told us to put fifteen minutes a day on our
study of the rifle, and especially in learning to
squeeze (a mystery which I will expound to you
when I myself have mastered it) the whole company
groaned. Our time is so cut up that it is
</p>
<p>(<i>The bugle and the whistle! Five minutes for
assembly.</i>)
</p>
<p>hard to find many minutes at a stretch which
you can devote to any one thing. And yet I
think it quite right that yesterday, after returning
from the open order drill, squad after squad of us
should of our own accord go down to the drill
field and practise the new tricks, especially in
preserving the squad formation while following
the corporal over whatever ground and through
whatever angles. Those fifteen minutes will help
us today. Bannister tends quietly to his job,
an amusing fellow with his little imitations of a
farmer (which some day he means to be), his
chuckling Yankee wit, and his interest in telling
all about his wife and children at home.
</p>
<p>Speaking of corporals, Corder has brought out
new facts regarding Knudsen. Yesterday, when
the tent was empty but for us three, Corder
stopped Knudsen from going out while at the
same time he beckoned to me. Lucy, coming in
just then, stopped and listened also. &#8220;Knudsen,&#8221;
said Corder, &#8220;you&#8217;ve drilled before.&#8221; &#8220;Not
infantry drill,&#8221; answered Knudsen. &#8220;Recently?&#8221;
demanded Corder. Knudsen admitted, &#8220;All last
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
winter with a troop of cavalry.&#8221; &#8220;Then why,&#8221;
demanded Corder, &#8220;didn&#8217;t you say you had had
experience, and try to be a corporal yourself?&#8221;
&#8220;Because&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>(<i>Bugle again, and half an hour for breakfast.
Having a little time before morning drill, I go on.</i>)
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Knudsen, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to be
corporal. I came here tired to death from a long
hard worrying year in getting that factory of
mine in good running order. I don&#8217;t want to have
anything more to do, for the whole of this month,
with managing a stupid gang of men.&#8221; &#8220;Thanks!&#8221;
said Corder and I together, and we bowed as if
we had been drilled to do it, exactly together.
Knudsen was rather taken aback, but he laughed
and apologized. &#8220;You ought to be corporal of a
squad,&#8221; said Corder. &#8220;Do you want to get me
out of this one?&#8221; demanded Knudsen. &#8220;Bannister
is all right. I tell you I&#8217;m here for a rest,
and I want to escape the captain&#8217;s notice.&#8221; We
promised (<i>Bugle!</i>) to help him keep in his obscurity.
Lucy stood silent, but full of admiration.
</p>
<p>(<i>Sergeant&#8217;s whistle, and Pickle comes running
in. &#8220;Make up the packs without the ponchos!&#8221;
Good by for the present.</i>)
</p>
<p>(<i>Four hours later, after skirmish practice in the
roughest kind of low underbrush, in which I nearly
lost a legging, and wished for a pair of wooden elbows.</i>)
</p>
<p>The company was split in two this morning,
those men who had used high-power rifles being
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
taken away by the captain, whose specialty is
shooting, while the rest of us went with the
lieutenant up the Peru road, and turned into an
old overgrown blueberry pasture. Luckily there
were no blueberries, for whenever we threw ourselves
flat we should have squashed more on our
clothes than we should have had time to eat.
Bannister being with the shooters, we (such as
remained of our squad) were put with a neighboring
corporal who did not know his business, and
</p>
<p>(<i>Forty minutes for mess. After a cigarette, I
am trying to snatch a few minutes now</i>)
</p>
<p>and speedily had the lieutenant &#8220;bawling us
out.&#8221; So very quietly, but very firmly, with
Corder again winking at me in perfect delight,
Knudsen took over corporal and squad, and
managed us in an undertone from his position of
number two. He kept the squad together, told
the corporal when to spread it out, and that innocent
person willingly gave himself into Knudsen&#8217;s
hands. We had plenty to do in a series of
</p>
<p>(<i>Bugle and whistle. Off for afternoon drill.&mdash;Now
at 3.24 P.M. after learning to pitch shelter tents</i>)
</p>
<p>imaginary attacks, sometimes in showers, and we
steaming in our ponchos or shivering without
them, ploughing through the wet bushes or throwing
ourselves flat in them. Then, from whatever
positions we found ourselves in, we had to &#8220;simulate
firing&#8221; at an enemy until my neck was lame
from trying to hold my head up, and my elbows
were sore from their rough lodgings. The corporal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
was perfectly docile, and Knudsen even hooked his
fingers in the back of the man&#8217;s belt and pulled
him here and there.
</p>
<p>(<i>Sergeant&#8217;s whistle, and again Pickle comes diving
into the tent. &#8220;Undershirts only, for the sun&#8217;s
out hot. Take your towel if you want to swim.&#8221;
That means calisthenics.&mdash;After forty minutes.</i>)
</p>
<p>Out we went to the drill field, took off (most
of us) our remaining shirts, and were put through
nine hundred exercises till we dripped, while
ladies in their automobiles watched us from the
top of the slope. Hope they enjoyed it. When
it was over we were dismissed where we stood and
streamed yelling to the beach, where we found
Champlain, at the hot end of this changeable
day, able to repay us for all our sufferings.
</p>
<p>Well, to finish the corporal story. The squad
were perfect lambs in Knudsen&#8217;s hands, none
daring to bleat, while all around us the other
squads were disputing in undertones and going
wrong amid storms of discontent. When we had
got back to the tent, and had lost our emergency
non-com., Knudsen began to praise him for an
excellent corporal. &#8220;He was good so long as you
had him in charge,&#8221; said Corder. &#8220;Especially
good on that last deployment when you yanked
him into place. If you don&#8217;t want to be promoted,
man, let your superiors blunder, and don&#8217;t
correct them.&#8221; &#8220;The lieutenant wasn&#8217;t looking,&#8221;
answered Knudsen meekly.
</p>
<p>Now about (<i>call for supper</i>) about that telegram
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
(<i>call for regimental conference. I am now at
the company tent waiting for the captain&#8217;s conference.</i>)
about that telegram of mine. <i>Where is
Vera Wadsworth?</i> For when we were on the
parade ground at the post this afternoon, learning
to pitch our shelter tents (which is another complicated
affair, the explanation of which I will
reserve) we found ourselves deserted for a while
by our mentor the lieutenant, and were at the
mercy of green sergeants, who knew something,
to be sure, but in whom we had no confidence.
Someone discovered him,&mdash;Pickle. &#8220;Gee,&#8221; said
that exponent of classic English, &#8220;spot the lieutenant
with a skirt.&#8221; And there he was at a
distance, in talk with a tall girl, handsome,
unless I miss my guess, and Vera herself, if I
have any knowledge of her figure, and of a certain
hat and parasol she lately affected. Quite
at home there too, without a chaperon, on the
walk in front of the officers&#8217; houses, and without
a waiting automobile that brought her or would
carry her away. What could bring her here?
Were her military relatives at this post? At any
rate, I thought they were now at the border. I
hope it wasn&#8217;t she; but the lieutenant, as he returned
to us, smiled as men usually do as they
think of Vera. Look up her whereabouts and let
me know.
</p>
<p>I see the captain coming to conference. Good
night,

<p>Your telegram, reaching me, made me uncomfortable
at first. However, I don&#8217;t suppose I

</p>
<p>Last night there was a rain, which wakened
me as it came down pretty heavily. Knudsen,
with a groan, got out of bed and put on his
poncho. &#8220;What is up?&#8221; I asked, whispering;
and he, likewise trying not to wake the others,
answered, &#8220;Rain is coming in. Must fix the
tent-cap.&#8221; So I got up and helped him. I did
not tell you, I think, that the tent is open at the
top like a wigwam, providing perfect ventilation;
but when the rain comes in it wets the clothes
hung around the poles, and also the rifles. But
a canvas cap, which in fair weather is laid back,
may be dragged over the opening by ropes hauled
from below, and Knudsen and I managed to close
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
it. Maybe you think it was fun, falling over the
tent-ropes in the windy dark.
</p>
<p>By daylight it was raining still, and we were
ordered out in our ponchos for the assembly.
Poor Lucy has so far always been helped into his,
and stood looking at it hopelessly. &#8220;Which side
is front?&#8221; As usual, Knudsen came to his help.
&#8220;The long side. No, that&#8217;s inside out. Don&#8217;t
you see the collar? Button it under your chin.
Now button the sides of the lower part round
behind you. Fix the two remaining corners to
hang down over your hands. Now you&#8217;re good
for anything that may happen all day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All day?&#8221; demanded poor Lucy. &#8220;Do you
mean to say we&#8217;ll drill in the rain?&#8221; &#8220;Shall
we sit and suck our thumbs here?&#8221; demanded
amused Pickle. Knudsen, more subtle, merely
remarked, &#8220;Oh, damn the weather!&#8221; and Lucy
stiffened as he got the idea that the rain wouldn&#8217;t
hurt him.
</p>
<p>He is really improving. Daily he manfully
shaves himself for practice (every other day would
be enough) and his early wounds are healing
nicely, while he has none of recent date. The
poor lad&#8217;s hands are pretty sore from handling
his gun. The captain halted before him the
other day as we were doing the manual, and fixed
him with a cold eye. &#8220;Hit that gun harder,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t hurt it with your hands.&#8221;
David faintly smiled, and now he is trying to
callous his palms.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>We ate our breakfasts in our ponchos: there is
no place to hang them up, and they make very
good bibs. And in our ponchos we marched;
they covered the packs, making us look like
pedlers, or as Knudsen said, like camels. We
kept our rifles dry under them, but were not long
dry ourselves, for these service ponchos not being
exactly waterproof, soon wet through at the knees,
or wherever else we rubbed as we marched. I
am therefore rather envious of David&#8217;s fine new
poncho, of best rubber. If I come again I shall
have one of my own&mdash;a poncho, remember, and
not the civilian rubber coat with which some
have supplied themselves.
</p>
<p>They marched us this morning first to the post
gymnasium, and there we sat in a great half-circle
while Major Stewart explained to us the
history of army packs, and some facts about the
one that bears his name. Our men in other wars
have abandoned their packs on entering battle,
they were such encumbrances in skirmishing.
In the battle of San Juan thousands of packs were
dropped by the roadside, and the men finished
their fighting without rations. But the new pack
may be worn both in marching and in shooting;
further, on expecting battle the rolls may be made
short, and then are strapped to the lower part of
the haversack. This part, on drawing out a
leather strap, falls to the ground, and the men go
forward lightened of the heaviest part of their
burden, but yet carrying food enough for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
day&#8217;s work. At its worst the Stewart pack is,
compared to the old blanket roll, many pounds
to the good.
</p>
<p>And yet, mother, though wise Mr. Bryan has
bragged of our ability to put an army of a million
men into the field overnight, of the few thousands
at the border a fair half are still equipped with
the old pack. Is the rest of the million to be proportionately
well fitted out?
</p>
<p>In order to show that the pack will fit anyone,
the Major called for the tallest man in the regiment.
A strapping big fellow of perhaps thirty-five
got up and stepped confidently onto the platform,
amid the cheers of the crowd, and the
Major prepared to strap the pack onto him.
But I heard from behind me various urgent
cries of &#8220;Go on up!&#8221; and a fine young fellow,
straight as a lance, walked round the seated men,
and also stepped upon the platform. Though
much slenderer than the other, the newcomer was
a good inch taller. A roar of applause came from
the regiment, and the first man, understanding,
laughed and stepped down. Then he turned
back and spoke to the younger man, evidently
asking his height. &#8220;How tall? How tall?&#8221; demanded
the crowd, and the young fellow held
up six fingers, indicating six feet six. A similar
scene occurred for the shortest man, a thin little
fellow getting the honor; then a third aspirant,
being evidently taller, was laughed back. But
what struck me was the reception given a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
head-headed, round-headed, roly-poly little mustached
fellow, who hesitated near at hand. The crowd
instantly nicknamed him. &#8220;Come on, Cupid,
and measure yourself.&#8221; But Cupid had his
doubts, and so retired.
</p>
<p>The lecture being over, luckily so was the
rain; but the captain took us out on that rolling
country that flanks the Peru road, and gave us
a fight with an imaginary enemy, through wet
bushes, across a dump, over and among little sand
and gravel pits, finally ambushing with great
care an innocent Catholic cemetery. As we did
this badly, on our advance exposing ourselves to
the fire from the ornamental statuary, we had to
do it over again. It was difficult practice, keeping
in line; but it was fairly exciting to throw yourself,
at command, flat on your face wherever you
happened to be. I thus gained intimate acquaintance
with a pile of tin cans, a scrub hard pine, and
a big hill of black ants. As the proper method of
moving sideways, when in skirmish line, is to
roll, I rolled away from the latter position, not
to the betterment of my poncho.
</p>
<p>This afternoon, again in rain, we marched to
the gymnasium once more, and the building not
having been ventilated, found the air very oppressive
after our hearty dinner. The captain
talked to us of the rifle and its use in target shooting;
but conditions were against him, for it was a
very sleepy crowd that listened. I found myself
drowsy, men were nodding all about me, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
Corder declared that he had 247 distinct and
separate naps. But it was necessary to rouse
when we were required to adjust our slings and
take position for snapping at a mark. The sling
is the strap of the gun, which when fitted to the
upper arm, and the arms and body braced against
the pull of it, in some mysterious way gives
steadiness. Our calisthenics were partly devised,
I am sure, to help us take the contortionists&#8217; attitudes
necessary for this graceful exercise. But
nothing, not even our skirmishing, prepared my
elbows for our final stunt of throwing ourselves
prone on the hard floor, and in approved target-shooting
posture snapping ten shots at the third
button of the captain&#8217;s shirt, while the lieutenant
counted ninety seconds by his watch.
</p>
<p>Returning, we found that rifle-inspection was
scheduled, with a special warning that the captain
was not satisfied with the way we kept the
guns. So we got out our single cleaning-rod and
passed it from cot to cot, with the nitro-solvent
and the oil, and such few patches as yet remained
to us. For no amount of them will satisfy one
company, or even one squad, and we are always
short. The rifles cleaned, we policed the tent,
making it absolutely neat. Now such are the
acoustic properties of these canvas dwellings that
we can hear what goes on in our neighbors&#8217;, and
so it happened that we heard, from tent 6, Randall&#8217;s
controversy with the rest of his squad. It
is seldom that one man will talk down seven, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
we heard the whole of his obstinate defense, how
that he hadn&#8217;t known that he was tent-policeman
for the day, that no one had policed the tent yesterday,
or eke the day before, that it was a sin
and a shame to make him do other men&#8217;s work,
that especially in the matter of the smoky lantern,
which no one had cleaned since the opening
of camp, it was wrong to make him bear the burden
of accumulated neglect. Some of us chuckled
at all this, but at such a clamor raised for the
purpose of escaping duty David listened soberly.
&#8220;He works very hard to avoid work,&#8221; said the
boy, whose good manners will not let him evade
any duty which he clearly perceives&mdash;though I
will admit that his perceptions are still rather
dull.
</p>
<p>The row died down, we heard the rattle of the
lantern, and then Randall&#8217;s voice. &#8220;I was only
jollying you.&#8221; No answer, but still the lantern
rattled. &#8220;I&#8217;m willing to do my share of the
work.&#8221; Still no answer. &#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; said Randall
finally, &#8220;if you feel that way about it, give
me the lantern. I&#8217;ll clean it.&#8221; We heard the
corporal&#8217;s voice. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got it nearly cleaned.
And you can squeak out of your work, Randall;
but just the same, we&#8217;ve got our opinion of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I thought the corporal had the best of it. It
is no small penalty to carry around the squad&#8217;s
opinion of one&#8217;s shortcomings.
</p>
<p>At inspection time the rain was heavy, and
word was passed to wait for the captain in our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
tents. For this we blessed him, seeing no fun in
standing in line in the street; and Lucy found that
after all the weather is considered in the army.
When it was the turn of tent 8 we lined up facing
each other, and the captain, stooping to get his
hat safely through the door, came in between our
two lines. He said &#8220;Just give me your guns as
I&#8217;m ready for them,&#8221; a deceptively mild beginning,
we feared, knowing how sharp he could be. But
at the fourth gun he said, &#8220;The rifles are not so
bad.&#8221; I handed him mine, breech open, hoping
that it was up to the average. He tried to look
down the barrel; then when he snorted I declare
I felt like a boy before his schoolmaster. But to
my relief he laughed, took from the muzzle the
plug that I had put there in expectation of a long
wait in the rain, looked through the barrel, and
passed it. When he left he told us to turn out
for Retreat with ponchos only&mdash;for which again
we blessed him.
</p>
<p>As the absence of conference, on account of
rain, gives me extra time, I shall write a dissertation,
not on roast pig, but just on pig, in other
words on table manners. Our company has a
corner of one of the mess shacks, into which we
are marched. When first we came our method
was to stand, hats on, by our places, where our
cups and plates were waiting upside down. At
the command &#8220;H Company, take seats!&#8221; (and
much merriment a sergeant once made when he
commanded &#8220;Be seated!&#8221;) we took off our hats
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
very decorously, hung them up (whether behind
us on the walls or in front of us under the tables)
sat down, turned over our plates, and reached for
the dishes. Now some tables, or sections of tables,
still maintain this lofty standard of good breeding,
by the sheer fact that the most of the men are
well bred and the rest are ashamed not to be.
But where the proportion is reversed degeneration
is rapid. The men furtively hang up their hats
and turn over their plates before the order, and
if a bunch of them take to doing this, there appears
to be no remedy for it. &#8220;It&#8217;s up to you,&#8221;
said a sergeant to us on the first day. &#8220;You can
be gentlemen, or you can be the other thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So it is after we are seated. Certain actions
are natural, as determined by the fact that while
there is plenty of food, there is never on the table
at one time enough of any one thing. (A few
more dishes and platters would apparently remedy
this.) Further, we haven&#8217;t time to wait. So we
begin on what happens to be in front of us, cereal
first at one end of the table, fruit first in the
middle (if there is any!), eggs and bacon further
along; thus by degrees we work through the bill
of fare. And this is not improper.
</p>
<p>But when the fellows take to laying in supplies
of whatever is within reach, and surrounding
themselves with plates heaped with the substance
of future courses, it is first unfair and next demoralizing.
If one man hogs the available supply
for merely later use, he teaches his neighbor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
to do the same in self-defense. And so you can
watch the proof of the old copy-book motto concerning
evil communications.
</p>
<p>A word concerning reaching at table, for your
guidance, my dear mother, when next you find
yourself at a table d&#8217;hote. I calculate that for
this method of helping one&#8217;s self there is a wrong
way and a right. Imagine yourself beside a busy
person beyond whom lies the wished-for dish.
If you reach with the arm nearest the dish, your
arm goes across your neighbor&#8217;s plate, a fact
which my neighbors have frequently proved to
me. But if you reach with the arm furthest from
the dish you will not cross his plate, your body
swinging your arm in over the table. I come
to this interesting social discovery rather late in
life, on account of the excellent table service to
which you have accustomed me.
</p>
<p>There goes the warning bugle. If I am not
safely tucked up in my little bed at taps, the
sergeant will say &#8220;Tut! Tut!&#8221; So good night.

<h2><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Mrs. Godwin to Her Son Richard, in a Letter<br />Dated September 14, 1916</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Your telegram, my dear, dear Dick, I have just
replied to, and will now add such facts as I know
concerning Vera&#8217;s going to Plattsburg. What I
can tell you comes through her sister Frances,
with whom I have always been more intimate
than Vera, even when you two were engaged.
And Frances has come several times to the house,
now that you are gone. I asked her to.
</p>
<p>If the breaking of your engagement was a blow
to your pride, my dear boy, think what it was to
Vera&#8217;s. I don&#8217;t know anyone prouder than she.
And to publish the fact that you two had changed
your minds&mdash;! She wanted to go away, but the
Wadsworths are nearly as poor as they are proud,
and she didn&#8217;t feel justified. Then there came a
letter from her cousin Dolly, who married that
handsome Captain Marsh and was stationed at
Plattsburg. Dolly&#8217;s husband is now on the border,
and Dolly could stand the separation no longer.
She was going to Texas, and one of the cousins
must come to Plattsburg and take charge of her
house. The children wouldn&#8217;t be a burden, because
there was the very capable nurse who had
taken care of them since they were born. And
old Colonel Marsh wouldn&#8217;t be a bother, having a
certain routine which got him through his days
very well. Of course it would be very dull with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
all the officers away from the post, and those at
the instruction camp constantly busy. But one
of the sisters must come and relieve her, or Dolly
would go mad. She is all bound up in that husband
of hers.
</p>
<p>It was plain that she expected Frances to come,
being so domestic, and so old-fashioned-womanly.
But Vera, you know, in spite of her suffragism
and her feminism has always been kept by her
father from having anything to do, and so she
had nothing to occupy herself with just when she
needed occupation most. So she declared that
she must go, and of course Frances let her.
&#8220;But you know,&#8221; said Frances to me, looking
up from her sewing with a little twinkle, &#8220;I know
Vera will be in hot water with the old Colonel
from the first, she is so out of sympathy with
war, and the military life, and all it has (or hasn&#8217;t)
to offer women.&#8221; That&#8217;s her sex independence,
you see.
</p>
<p>Vera can&#8217;t know that you&#8217;re there. She went
just before you so suddenly made up your mind
to go, and Frances hasn&#8217;t written her of your
going. I told her I shouldn&#8217;t tell you, and begged
her not to write Vera. And unless Vera recognizes
you, which isn&#8217;t likely, she will know nothing
of your whereabouts.
</p>
<p>It is odd that David Farnham is in your squad,
and amusing that I should have seen his mother
only yesterday. She never was so proud of anything
in her life as of the fact that he is at Plattsburg.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
So she has become a perfect nuisance to
her friends, talking of him so. I met her at a
Bridge, and she was crazy to see me, David having
written her that you two are together. So she
got herself put at my table, and our two partners
were furious, because the game dwindled
away to nothing, she talking of David all the
time. You would have thought that he was the
whole army and navy of these United States. I
was at first quite frightened that she would ask
me your opinion of his fitness. But not at all;
that was quite settled in her mind. She talked
about his deciding to go, and how he made her
see that it was the best thing for him and for the
country&mdash;and there is a story to that, because it
was her husband that insisted on her letting David
go, when she would have kept him. And she
talked of his equipment, how horrid it was that
he couldn&#8217;t dress like the officers, especially his
legs, they are so handsome; but he wasn&#8217;t allowed
to wear puttees or leather leggings, but must wear
those canvas things. And she gave him everything
new; she even mentioned those French silk
pajamas that so amuse you. And then she was
indignant that he was not at once made a lieutenant,
or something. And the men in his tent,
except you, Dick, are of no social standing whatever.
Of course she hadn&#8217;t heard of his being
called Lucy. She was so satisfied that I wanted
to tell her. Do write me more of him.

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>Our good Lucy is a different lad from the one
that landed here a week ago. Did I tell you that
he has come to the heroic resolution to clean his
own gun? I suppose the strongest factor in that
is his detestation of Randall. It&#8217;s quite common
here for fellows to get the regulars to clean their
guns, and there&#8217;s more to be said for that than
for many other indulgences: at least it&#8217;s better
for the rifles. The regulars drive a good little
trade of this kind, and David has twice sent out
his piece to be laundered, as it were. But I know
that he perceived that the sentiment of the squad
is against it, and I think he&#8217;s sensitive enough to
understand the reasons. We&#8217;re all here to learn
to be soldiers, and taking care of his gun is a
pretty important part of a soldier&#8217;s job. And
then we&#8217;re an economical crowd. David and I
are the only ones in the squad that didn&#8217;t have
to pinch a little in order to get here; even Corder
spoke recently of the expense as something unwelcome.
So it&#8217;s really rather bad form to pay
for outside service. Yet for all that, David
couldn&#8217;t quite bring himself to do the dirty work.
</p>
<p>So when a regular came to us yesterday, before
inspection, and asked for guns to clean, David
began to get his gun out of the rack. He looked a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
little uneasily at Knudsen, but the Swede wouldn&#8217;t
see it; he kept squinting through his own piece.
The regular, to make matters sure, said, &#8220;Mr.
Randall told me you&#8217;d give me your gun. I
always clean his.&#8221; With the funniest little set of
his jaw, as if he didn&#8217;t quite know how to do it,
David reached for the cleaning rod. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;Mr. Randall is mistaken. I clean my gun
myself.&#8221; Then he sat down beside Knudsen, as
if sure that the other would teach him&mdash;in which
he was right. His dirty hands at the end were a
sad sight to him, and yet I think he was proud
of them too.
</p>
<p>This morning Randall, who hasn&#8217;t learned
(and I question if he ever will) how unwelcome
he is in our tent, came in to brag a little&mdash;and of
what! There stands to the south of us a big
hotel whose bulk is visible from the camp, a
strong temptation to all our luxurious budding
Napoleons. Randall was there last night, and
came in to tell us what he had to eat. Particularly
he enjoyed, he said, the fresh asparagus
tips. Pickle&#8217;s envy overcame his dislike, and he
had nothing to say. But David&#8217;s eye gleamed.
&#8220;Fresh asparagus tips?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Scarcely
that.&#8221; &#8220;Indeed?&#8221; demanded Randall. &#8220;I know
asparagus when I eat it.&#8221; &#8220;But not fresh asparagus,&#8221;
countered David. &#8220;It&#8217;s not to be had
in September. Canned tips, Randall, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;
And Pickle, in his relief, cackled aloud.
</p>
<p>I have of late told you so little of our officers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
that I must say something about them here, of
officers as a class, and ours in particular. We are
at the stage of theoretical conferences&mdash;after the
regimental meeting each night on the drill-field
is a company conference at each company tent,
where the non-coms are expected to go, and
where all others are invited. Consequently the
captain or lieutenant has forty men there each
night, crowded close around the table and packed
at the open side of the tent. We are learning the
theory of field skirmish work, with a glance at
the method of advancing by road into an enemy&#8217;s
country.
</p>
<p>And I must say that our officers have at their
tongues&#8217; ends the whole of the principle that is
embodied in that strange little book, the drill
regulations. As soon as you have got beyond the
mere parade-ground work (and that is all the
civilian ever sees) the book brings you to a region
where nothing else is considered than the one
thing, attack, attack, attack. There is something
very grim and inexorable in this primer of
war, this A B C of the principles of destruction.
And if the innocent little pocket manual contains
a codification, so condensed as to be amazing, of
the ways to slay your enemy, the officers are
ready with every possible amplification of its dry
paragraphs. Get forward, always get forward, is
their intention. Make your fire effective, make it
destructive, make it overwhelming. With word,
with blackboard plan and section, with theory,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
with practical illustration, each night they lay
before us some new field of this really awful knowledge.
We study it eagerly. Two years ago I
should have been horrified at these doctrines that
they preach. Today I regard knowledge of them,
by a sufficient number of able-bodied men, as the
great need of the country.
</p>
<p>So much, dear mother, of things which to speak
of in detail would only pain your kind heart. As
to the men that teach us, I can say that they
improve upon acquaintance. Each of them, the
captain and lieutenant, has his own way of
teaching. In the lieutenant a coolness of statement
that seems to imply a calm unshakableness,
as of one who has measured all risks and sees
that they amount to nothing. In the captain
equal clearness but more fire. Both see that the
only safety is in attack. They answer our questions
quite differently, the lieutenant with a crisp
completeness that leaves nothing to inquire but
much to ponder on, the captain with an illuminating
phrase that humanizes everything and brings
instant understanding. Their men will go wherever
they send them in a fight, for the lieutenant
because they know he must be right, for the captain
because they feel it.
</p>
<p>We never, I think, can know the lieutenant
very well, because of that quality which I saw in
him at his first appearance before us, an aloofness
that taunts us into the determination to please
him. The captain I am sure we know already, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
worker, a driver, but one who shows us that he
understands our mistakes by the very keenness
of his irony. &#8220;I have found you men to place the
hip anywhere between the armpit and the knee.
So I will place it for you at the watch pocket.
That is your official hip, gentlemen.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,
skirmishers in Europe are now wearing steel helmets.
But if you men don&#8217;t better learn to keep
under cover you won&#8217;t need steel helmets, you&#8217;ll
need battleships.&#8221; &#8220;You can&#8217;t take too many
precautions in the use of your guns. In this
game with me out in front, I&#8217;m an advocate of
safety first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The men like him, but more than that, they
respect him. You know, mother, that I can tell
something at first hand about learning one&#8217;s job.
But these officers put the average civilian to shame.
I doubt if there is stronger professional feeling,
or a higher standard of professional achievement,
anywhere in the world. If all the other officers
are like our two, West Pointers are a formidable
body of men.

<h2><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Extracts From the Letters of Vera Wadsworth<br />To Her Sister Frances</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><i>Sep. 6, 1916.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Frances</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t imagine what a relief it is to be where
there are no men. That may seem to you a curious
statement, for here there are practically no
women at all, and nothing but men in the landscape
from morning till night. But there are
no men buzzing about. It was disgusting to me
that no sooner was my engagement to Dick
broken than the rushing recommenced. I am so
glad to be where no one pays me any attention
at all. The place will be flooded in a few days
with a thousand new rookies, but they will be
nothing else to me than trees or bushes, and I
can still have peace.
</p>
<p>There are ladies here whom I have met, and
shall meet again. Only I feel no interest in them
just now, except that the two I am likeliest to see
most of are such as always rouse my pity, overburdened
with the cares of children and a social
position on a small salary. And the money of
one of them has just stopped coming in because
her husband, at the border, allowed an emergency
purchase which the auditing department at Washington
will not pass. You know that in such a
case the officer&#8217;s pay stops until the deficiency is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
made up or the matter is explained. No one
questions his honesty, but his wife and children
suffer. And a man will ask a woman to take that
risk with him!
</p>
<p>The Colonel is the nicest old gentleman, very
courteous. There is no doubt that army officers
have delightful manners; he begs my pardon
every time he lights his pipe. Cannot afford
cigars, of course. And threadbare, but very
neat. But what is the use of courtesy and self-denial
if you believe in war, make war your
business?
</p>
<p>He and I have had it out already. Neither
of us made the slightest impression on the other.
His argument is the old one: be prepared, and
people will let you alone. He cannot be made to
see that if a man has a gun, or a nation has an
army, the temptation to use it will some day become
too strong.
</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t given him my opinion of the army as
a profession <i>for women</i>. He always ends our discussion
with a charming compliment. But I am
aching to point out to him the condition of the
house we live in, where the new has all come off
of Dolly&#8217;s wedding presents, the chair covers are
wearing out, holes are coming in the napkins, and
there is no money for replacements. How Dolly
could pay for her trip to the border, or keep
herself there, I can&#8217;t think. Suppose the children
are sick!
</p>
<p>Oh, my dear, I am so weary of genteel poverty!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
Why couldn&#8217;t I have married Dick? He worked
so hard, and got himself such a fine position, that
we should have been so comfortable! And then
we had to conclude that we weren&#8217;t made for each
other. I do so regret it, and yet there was nothing
else possible. Perhaps I&#8217;m not made for marriage
after all.

<p>The town, as I told you, is flooded with recruits,
of the amateur variety. But our post is a
little oasis all by itself, and except that they come
and drill on the parade ground, they do not come
near us. Did I tell you that out in front of the
house, merely across a driveway, is this great field
where the training companies man&oelig;uvre morning
and afternoon, and where they occasionally have
regimental or battalion drill? Luckily our small
piazza is all grown over with vines, so that I can
sit outside for the air and yet not myself be seen.
The old Colonel watches it all with the keenest
interest, tells me what they do and what they fail
to do, and I am even learning the meaning of a
few military terms. He approves of the way in
which the new men learn, and is very proud of
what they are achieving. But it has got so with
me that I pay no more attention to the drilling
men than to automobiles going by. And when
their hours are over the place is almost as deserted
as before.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<hr class='tb' />

<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><i>Sept. 13.</i></p>
</div>

<p>I am rather annoyed by the fact that now that
the training camp is settling into its routine, its
officers&mdash;the unmarried ones&mdash;find time to come
calling on the Colonel. Of course the dear old
man is delighted to see them, and doesn&#8217;t tell me
that he has helped to spread the report that an
eligible young woman is staying with him. I
wish he hadn&#8217;t. For I have found out that military
men are twice as bad as civilians. They
are aggressive by nature, or they wouldn&#8217;t have
chosen the profession; they are aggressive by
education; three minutes after they are introduced
they begin a flirtation. There is a lieutenant
Pendleton here for whom I am sure I am
the twenty-seventh, so skilful is he in his operations.
I have known him two days, and I expect
him to propose tomorrow. There are three others
who are only a day, or at most two days, behind.
You know them, the dashing, fascinating kind.
</p>
<p>Another officer, Lt. Pendleton&#8217;s captain, named
Kirby, I cannot quite make out. He doesn&#8217;t make
love; he discusses tactics with the colonel. Yet
he comes quite regularly, and keeps me in sight.
He seems grimmer, more tenacious than the others;
I&#8217;m glad he gives his time to the Colonel rather
than to me. His voice has a curious quality, a
most unmilitary gentleness. Pendleton, when he
gets you in a corner, purrs to you alone; yet you
feel that he has claws. His voice rings on the
parade ground; I&#8217;m sure of it. I can&#8217;t make out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
what Captain Kirby&#8217;s would sound like. There is
a deceptive sympathy to it, deceptive because
I feel in him much purpose. When an army
officer can&#8217;t flirt he either likes his profession too
little or he likes it too much.
</p>

<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><i>Sep. 14.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This morning, on our little porch, I was sitting
sewing behind the vines when Captain Kirby
came marching his company onto the parade
ground before the house. And then I learned
what his voice was like, my dear. Not gentle at
all; very deep, very strong, curiously resonant,
as if he were shouting through a trumpet. And
how do you suppose he treated his men, so many
of whom are gentlemen, or older than he, or earning
bigger salaries. Like schoolboys! I first saw
him when he was standing out in front of them,
holding in his hand, swinging by the strap, a
rifle that he must have taken from one of them.
Said he: &#8220;When you&#8217;re at route step, I want you
not to carry your guns like suit-cases. You
aren&#8217;t a gang of porters. If I had the money I&#8217;d
tip you all; but cut out this red-cap stuff. And
don&#8217;t carry it <i>so</i>.&#8221; He put it across his shoulders,
pointing right and left. &#8220;You&#8217;ll put out the eye
of the man on your right, and bash the ear of the
man on your left. Now remember, Nature is a
great provider. She has made shoulders specially
for the carrying of rifles. Carry your rifle on one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
shoulder or the other, or hang them by the straps
from one shoulder or the other. And by no other
way.&#8221; As if they had to obey him in every little
thing!
</p>
<p>Then he worked them! Nothing satisfied him.
At each mistake, a blast of sarcasm. He spoke
of the &#8220;accordion-pleated line.&#8221; He gave a fling
at a lost corporal: &#8220;As soon as we recover our
derelict flanking squad, now about a hundred
yards ahead.&#8221; The men came slinking back. He
withered one individual. &#8220;That belt is on exactly
right. Except that it&#8217;s upside down and
inside out, it&#8217;s exactly right.&#8221; At whatever distance
he went, I could hear every word. And
whenever the company came close, I could hear
the men in the ranks, murmur, murmur, murmur.
You can&#8217;t treat such men so. Of course they&#8217;re
disgusted with him.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><i>Sep. 15.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Such a humiliation today! And such a discovery!
I suppose you didn&#8217;t tell me that Dick
was here because you thought I&#8217;d prefer not to
know it. We&#8217;re perfectly aware of each other&#8217;s
neighborhood now. This is the way of it.
</p>
<p>This afternoon, being tired of the continual
drilling on the parade ground, I slipped away
before it could begin, and leaving the Colonel at
his nap, went walking out a gravel road that I&#8217;ve
for some time wished to explore. It took me
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
along a rather desolate tract of scrub land, with
nothing ahead but the distant Adirondacks; so
at last, seeing a little hill to the left, I thought I&#8217;d
try if I could see the lake from it, and perhaps sit
there awhile in quiet. I struck out across this
piece of very desolate country, with little bushes
growing but no grass, not good for pasture nor
for anything but one purpose which I didn&#8217;t then
suspect. Soon I found myself walking along a
ditch which kept cutting me off from the hill, a
ditch in the driest of sandy land and as deep
as my chin, all shored up with cut poles, or sometimes
with plank, or with bundles of twigs, or
with willow basket work. And then I saw it was
a trench!
</p>
<p>The Plattsburgers must have made it. It ran
all about, experimentally. It had here a shelter
of sandbags, there a dugout, there a kitchen.
It was made in different ways to show how to use
material, I suppose. Really it was very clever.
And then when I came too near it at one place,
to study it, the rotten wood gave way with me,
and so as not to have to fall I was forced to jump,
right down into it. And there I was! When I
tried to get up at the half-broken place, I was
overwhelmed by a shower of sand. Everywhere
else the walls were too high for me to climb out.
So I took to walking along it, and it twisted all
around, with passages like a maze, but nowhere
a place to climb. At one corner I met a horrible
great snake, helpless down there too. But it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
went one way and I went the other, till I came to
a little niche with a cover overhead, and a loophole
looking along the waste of scrub. Outside
a little sign said, &#8220;Machine-gun emplacement.&#8221;
And there I stood looking out for a sign of help.
</p>
<p>Then I heard Captain Kirby&#8217;s voice, no one
could mistake it, and I was relieved till I understood
what he was saying. &#8220;Less noise, men!
You couldn&#8217;t creep up on a dead tree that way.
It would hear you coming.&#8221; The horrible thing
had all his hundred and fifty men there, and in a
moment I began to see them, little glimpses of
olive-drab pushing through the bushes. I heard
his voice again: &#8220;By squads from the right!&#8221; then
corporals&#8217; voices, then the rushing of men, then
more corporals and more rushing. All the time,
from nowhere that I could see, came a continual
clicking&mdash;the absurd creatures were pretending
to fire on the trench where I was standing. I
began to get more glimpses of men running
stooped and throwing themselves flat, heard the
captain&#8217;s war-horn, and a little further away the
lieutenant&#8217;s voice like a bugle.
</p>
<p>For this sort of playing soldier I suppose it was
really pretty well done. I knew they were all the
time coming nearer, but I couldn&#8217;t get anything
but glimpses of them. And after a while I knew
they were behind a line of bushes some fifty yards
away, where I heard their continuous clicking;
but they showed only an occasional hat. Then
I heard the captain&#8217;s voice, &#8220;Front rank, simulate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
fix bayonets!&#8221; and in a moment, full of sarcasm:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t draw that bayonet! I said <i>simulate</i>.
Don&#8217;t you understand the English language?&#8221;
The clicking kept up at only half rate, and I saw
a few rifle muzzles; then the rear rank pretended
the same; then I heard the order, &#8220;Prepare to
charge!&#8221; And it was all dead silence.
</p>
<p>There was nothing that I could do but peep
through my loophole, and think how silly it all
was. I heard a roar from the captain, an outburst
of yells, the crash of the bushes, and&mdash;there
was the captain coming like a bull, and a
long rank of men rising behind him and rolling
on toward me in a wave. Oh, Frances dear, there
is something awful about brute force! I felt the
ground shake, the noise of the shouting seemed to
burst my ears, the faces in front of me were like
those of angry demons. I&#8217;m ashamed that their
toy soldiering was so real to them that it [the
word <i>frightened</i> evidently crossed out] was too
much for me, and I turned away and put my
hands to my ears.
</p>
<p>Then it was all over. I heard them crying
&#8220;Halt!&#8221; and walked out into the open trench, to
see a line of men laughing and panting just
above me. Only a few saw me at first; the rest
were saying &#8220;That was some charge!&#8221; and similar
self-praise. I said, &#8220;Will you please help me out?&#8221;
The men nearest me were very respectful. One
leaped down beside me, laid down his gun, and
held his hands for me to step in, a blond man, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
real soldier, with flashing blue eyes. Half a dozen
hands were held for me above, and the captain
came pushing in to help, with such an anxious
face! But I heard someone say, &#8220;Give me your
hand, Vera!&#8221; and there was Dick! He and the
blond man had me out in a moment, and Dick
took me through the line and got me quickly away
toward the road I had left. I sent him back, but
he would not leave me till he was sure I was all
right. He was very handsome, and grave, and
respectful. And oh! wasn&#8217;t it all stupid? I am
disgusted with the whole Tenth Training Regiment,
but more disgusted with myself.

<h2><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Extract From Private Godwin&#8217;s Daily Letter,<br />Of the Same Date</span></h2>
</div>

<p>... The fellows&#8217; eyes popped as I took Vera
through the line. She <i>is</i> a stunner! I saluted the
captain when I went back, and he did not ask
me to explain why I took so much on myself,
though the lieutenant, who came too late, I think
was furious with me. We yanked Knudsen out
of the trench, and the captain, forming us instantly,
marched us away in the direction that
Vera didn&#8217;t take. When he gave us rest she was
clean out of sight, and we lay down in the bushes
and loafed for a while.
</p>
<p>Nobody in the squad asked me a question.
Young David&#8217;s face was a study in ignorance,
but of course it was he who let the others know
that I was to be let alone. From his squad Randall
began to throw remarks at me, but Pickle
turned on him very savagely. &#8220;Oh, yap, yap,
yap!&#8221; Captain Kirby when he went by looked
at me very intently, and I looked straight back at
him. But I couldn&#8217;t look at any of the other
fellows. Curious that a man feels so self-conscious.
You women know how to pretend, but
few of us seem to manage it.
</p>
<p>Yet I wasn&#8217;t sorry it came about so. The
squad stands together on anything that happens
to any one of us. I felt proud to belong to it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
When we marched back and had got to the main
road again, the captain disappeared; it was the
lieutenant who got us to camp and dismissed us
there. I knew where the captain went when
after this evening&#8217;s mess I was ordered to go to
his tent. He was writing there, and turned round
when I <i>scratched</i>, which is a little way we have in
the army, as there is no way of knocking. I
saluted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Godwin,&#8221; said he, returning my
salute. &#8220;Miss Wadsworth sends a message.
You&#8217;re to come to see her this evening, after general
conference.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was planning to go to company conference,
sir,&#8221; said I.
</p>
<p>I suppose she knew I would say that, for he was
ready for me. &#8220;She made it an order, Mr. Godwin,&#8221;
said he, very gravely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, sir,&#8221; said I, saluted again, and left
him writing&mdash;or pretending to. I suppose she&#8217;s
got him, like the rest of them.
</p>
<p>When I called on Vera we were very proper,
and very old-friendly, and radically different in
our ideas, as it seems destined for us to be. I
told her how much I liked the training, and she
said how much she disapproved of it, and so we
passed the time. Once she insisted on telling me
all about what her sister Frances is doing now.
Then officers began to come in, and to chat with
the old colonel in the next room, and glance
through the door at us, as if saying, &#8220;When is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
that dam rookie going to go?&#8221; So I left. It was
nearly time, anyway, for me to be tucked up in
bed like a good little boy, and leave the field to
my betters.

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>We have just come back from general conference,
a nightly occurrence except in bad weather.
Tonight, because it was cold, the men went
grumbling and tardy, having put on sweaters
under their blouses, and the wise ones, on account
of the recent rains, bringing something to sit on.
In default of anything better a legging will do,
slipped off when we are on the ground. Our
speaker tonight told us of army law, too technical
for me to make it interesting to you. Some
speakers have hard work in making their subjects
interesting to us, not that these are dull, but that
the speakers are. Said Corder to me after one
such, &#8220;When I was a Sunday School superintendent
I let no one speak to the school that hadn&#8217;t
something to say.&#8221; Yet on the whole I am surprised
how well the officers can give us the gist of
their subjects.
</p>
<p>Our best speaker so far (excepting always the
General, who has a way of getting at us that explains
his success) was a youngish doctor, who
gave us a plain talk concerning personal hygiene.
When he spoke of cleanliness, briefly referring to
it as a matter of course, I thought of a man whom
I had seen on the beach that afternoon, Wednesday,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
looking at his feet and exclaiming in disgust:
&#8220;Look at them! And I washed them Monday
morning!&#8221; Some of our lads, who come here
with expenses paid by their employers, have a
little to learn in this particular.
</p>
<p>But to return to our doctor. He was very
jocose, expressed himself in perfectly decent men&#8217;s
slang, and kept us laughing <i>with</i> him all the time,
while at the same time he drove home his advice.
And yet it was very striking how once, not disrespectfully,
the men laughed <i>at</i> him. While speaking
of our diet he said, &#8220;I advise you to eat freely
of the excellent fruit provided at the camp
table.&#8221; Now with us fruit, cooked or raw, is
almost lacking, and nothing exasperates me quite
so much, when I remember the wonderful apples
that were just ripening at home, as to see the
small bruised insipid fruit that they serve us here.
So the men began to laugh, quietly at first; but
the laughter rippled from one end of the crowd to
the other, and then rose in waves, and then
boomed louder and louder, in one great hearty roar.
Whether or not the doctor saw the point, it was
worth taking.
</p>
<p>Today we went on outpost duty, posting our
squads at proper vantage points along the further
edge of our old familiar field, beyond the trenches
where Vera was trapped. The lieutenant took us
out, explaining as he went, dropping a squad on
every-other rise of the ground, and leaving its
corporal to post his men. Soon we were strung
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
out along half a mile of rough country, a railroad
in our front, and beyond it the enemy&#8217;s territory.
Looking from our vantage-point it was hard to
suppose that the barren pasture was hiding all
our men. Of them we saw but two, an advance
post lying on the hither side of the railroad embankment,
peering over the top, and our squad&#8217;s
own foremost man at his place where he could
command a railroad cut. The rest were hidden
in little hollows, in scattered clumps of pine, or
in patches of scrub oak. After a while along
came the visiting patrol, directed by each squad
onward to the next, and so covering the whole
front. And last came the captain, inspecting
each post, and when he was satisfied, sending us
back with orders to pick up the rest of our platoon
and re-form by the trenches. An incident of
this short march. Randall, when we routed out
Squad Six, produced his last cigarette. His
front rank man asked him for half. &#8220;No one
divides a cigarette,&#8221; said Randall, borrowed a
match from the man, and lighted the cigarette
himself. Our Lucy, after watching this in silent
amazement, took out his cigarette-box, found he
had but one smoke, and handed it over. Really,
if he becomes a man Randall should have half of
the credit.
</p>
<p>This afternoon we have at last made a beginning
on another part of our work, the use of the
rifle. Some few days ago the captain called for
those of us who had used high-powered rifles;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
he has since been weeding them out, till he has a
couple of dozen of them to use as coaches. Today
we went &#8220;on the galleries,&#8221; which is a convenient
phrase for the use of small-bore rifles
against small targets at short range. At the
bottom of the drill field we hung on wires small
wooden frames on which were tacked paper
targets; behind was the low railroad embankment,
behind that the lake. Our rifles were in every
detail like the service pieces, except the smaller
bore. We used dummy cartridges as long as the
gun usually requires, but so made as to receive
much smaller cartridges, carrying weak charges
of powder&mdash;if you understand the lingo, they were
&#8220;22 shorts.&#8221; One gang of us was kept at work
perpetually loading these gallery cartridges, and
assembling them in clips of five; another gang was
steadily tacking new targets on the frames; and
bunch by bunch we were moved from these duties
to the more interesting one of shooting the cartridges
and spoiling the targets.
</p>
<p>Since our recent talk in the gymnasium we have
been practising, at all odd minutes, how to hold
and sight the guns, and how to pull the trigger.
Never before coming here had I heard of the
<i>squeeze</i>, in which (of another kind) all army men
are popularly supposed to be proficient by nature,
but which here is technically a special study.
The greenhorn naturally supposes that all he has
to do with the gun is, like Stephen in the classic
rhyme, to &#8220;p&#8217;int de gun, pull on de trigger.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
But since the ordinary pull is a jerk that affects
the aim, some genius has invented the new
method. So we are taught first to grip the small
of the stock with the full hand, the thumb along
the side, and with the forefinger to take up the
slack of the trigger till it engages the mechanism,
and then to take a little more, till presently the
gun will go off. At this point, while using the
sling to secure a good aim, the shooter should
squeeze, that is, he should slowly and steadily
contract his whole hand, all the fingers together,
till in a moment&mdash;Bang!
</p>
<p>It sounds so easy!
</p>
<p>On the galleries, then, we were tested for our
understanding of this new art. The size of the
target and the distance, considered in relation to
the power of the two rifles, were about equal to
service conditions at five hundred yards. The
weight and size of the gun made the test a fair
one. We tried out the two chief postures, sitting
and prone, and had both slow and rapid fire, or
as the captain prefers to say, slow and deliberate.
</p>
<p>These are summaries and general facts. Personal
details are: long service in the two gangs,
long waits for my turn, and five minutes with
the gun. &#8220;Be sure to shoot on Number Twelve
target,&#8221; warned the coach as he helped me adjust
the sling. &#8220;Now get your position right.
Now put in the clip. And now remember your
squeeze.&#8221; I was trying slow fire, handling a gun
for the first time since I was a boy. &#8220;The top of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
the U of the open sight an inch below the bull,&#8221;
chanted the coach. &#8220;But the bullseye,&#8221; I complained,
&#8220;dances all about.&#8221; &#8220;Of course,&#8221; said
the coach. &#8220;Make it dance less, hold as steady
as you can, squeeze when the front sight is under
it.&mdash;There, you jerked!&#8221; So I did, but I squeezed
a little better as time went on, till I was pretty
sure I was doing all right. The gun didn&#8217;t kick,
and by my tenth shot I was fairly steady. I
gave up the gun after making sure it was empty,
waited till all the rest had finished, and at the
order we walked forward with new targets, hung
them in place of the old, tore ours off the frames,
and gave the frames over to the tacking squad,
while at the same time trying to compute our
scores before we filed up to the captain.
</p>
<p>I was amazed and disgusted to find that three
of my shots had missed the target quite. To the
captain, as he studied my target, I expressed my
mortification. &#8220;What target were you shooting
on?&#8221; he asked, in the lingo proper to our trade.
I answered &#8220;Number Twelve.&#8221; &#8220;Three shots
shy,&#8221; said the captain, &#8220;and here&#8217;s Number
Fourteen lacking two hits. Where&#8217;s Number
Thirteen?&#8221; &#8220;Here, sir,&#8221; said Bannister, &#8220;and
there&#8217;s fifteen shots in my target.&#8221; &#8220;Then three
are mine,&#8221; said I. &#8220;And two are mine,&#8221; said
Number Fourteen. My shooting hadn&#8217;t been
very good, threes and fours, with only one bull.
Bannister had nine bullseyes, some of which I
may have made; but he was privileged to count
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
all the best shots on his score.&mdash;I know now a
little more about target shooting than merely
holding the gun.
</p>
<p>Tomorrow we are to have more of this, although
it is Sunday. The captain has given us our evening
to ourselves, and has asked us (<i>asked</i>, you
notice, for our Sunday afternoon is our own) to
give him the time tomorrow. He has the reputation,
I am told, of always making his company
the best at rifle shooting. And if he works us,
he is also working himself.
</p>
<p>This spell of cold weather which has followed
our rains and is going to make life quite different
for us, has this evening driven everyone from
the company tent except myself, who sit here
wrapped in a blanket to my waist, finishing this
letter. There has been a very pleasant little
group of us here, using each other&#8217;s ink, interrupting
our work to stop and chat, showing each
other our photographs. And perhaps I had better
explain why it is that I have appeared in two or
three of the camp scenes which I have already
sent you. There is here an official photographer,
who sends out camera men to take us in all sorts
of occupations&mdash;on the skirmish line, on parade,
cleaning our teeth or our rifles, marching, skylarking.
The pictures are all of the post card
size, and in due course are exhibited at the studio,
where we go and inspect and buy. He is always
out of pictures of lieutenants, captains, the general,
and other popular subjects. But by perseverance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
and patient waiting one can accumulate
a record of his life here. Luck will put a fellow,
on an average, into a few groups a week, as you
see in the ones I have sent you.
</p>
<p>I am shivering. The captain has promised us
another blanket for tomorrow, and there are
rumors of an issue of overcoats. At this rate we
shall need them.

<p>Love from

<p style='text-align: right; '><i>Sunday evening the 17th.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>Not a minute for writing all day, and yet I
have been idle, idle, idle. My own personal
work began very early, for I got up about quarter
of five, took my shower-bath in the shivering
dawn, and then, while the camp was just beginning
to stir, and when I had the bucket and
spigot to myself, I washed out shirt, underclothes,
stockings, handkerchiefs, and pajamas. The water
was painfully cold, and often I had to stop and
warm my hands in my sweater. But I got the
work done, and hung the clothes on the lines,
knotted together, that are used to regulate the
caps on tents 8 and 10. The clothes-pins were
most useful, for the wind blew strongly all day,
and many a piece of laundry went sailing off to
leeward. Inspection compelled me to take the
things in once, but I got them out again, and in
the evening I had the pleasure of putting on
again, dry, the pajamas that I washed in the
morning. I never should have been able to fold
them properly for stowing away.
</p>
<p>Our inspection was very formidable this morning,
for the major was expected, and the captain
came down the street, and in his mildest voice
gave strictest orders. Washing was taken in,
extra clothes were taken down from tent-poles,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
and tents were made perfectly neat inside and
out. I was tent-policeman for the day, but my
job was light, for everyone was concerned to have
the place look well, and picked up round his cot,
borrowed the broom and wielded it, and laid out
his kit in the best of order. From the next tent
we heard Randall in his usual controversy with
his squad, refusing to help his neighbor roll up
the walls of the tent, and loudly complaining
when his washing and his rubber coat were thrown
on his cot with orders to put them out of sight.
But in spite of himself he was compelled to share
in the housecleaning. Outside, the street was
policed of every cigarette-butt and scrap of paper,
and then the two police squads, with rakes
and brooms, went down the whole length of it
and made it as orderly as a garden walk.
</p>
<p>Then at command we lined up outside the tents,
dressed in two lines down the street, facing each
other. Down this aisle came the Major, glancing
keenly about, and peering sharply into each tent.
Of our corporal he asked if we had blankets enough.
Captain Kirby came next with the first sergeant,
and carefully inspected each tent. Then he called
us all together in a circle, said that the major had
been unusually pleased with us; a man of few
words, he has seldom praised a company so
heartily. This set us all up. Then the captain,
for his own part, gave us his thanks, told us we&#8217;d
done well, and apologized for working us so hard.
&#8220;I know you hate me like the devil for it,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
said, &#8220;but you&#8217;re coming on finely.&#8221; And he
sent us to the galleries for more practice. We
went in some surprise at his opinion of himself.
&#8220;Hate him like the devil?&#8221; exclaimed Corder.
&#8220;The devil we do!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The waiting on the drill-field became very
tedious. So poor is our equipment that we have
but eighteen gallery rifles for our hundred and
fifty men, and it was nearly an hour before I got
my first try. My score this time was the reverse
of yesterday, for I got fifty-four out of a possible
fifty, one hundred and eight percent! That was
because there were thirteen holes in the paper,
someone having presented me with the extra
three. Counting all the best shots as my own,
my official score was 42; yet none of the shots
were outside the second ring, and at worst my
score was 39.
</p>
<p>In the afternoon my pride had a fall, for after
the same tedious wait I fired my ten rounds at
the target. This time I fired prone, both clips
within two minutes. This position, flat on my
belly with my legs apart (in our close quarters it
was difficult not to kick my neighbor, and destructive
of aim to have him kick me) with my elbows
under me and the gun, and my head bent back,
is in itself hard enough to maintain during a
single shot. But for rapid fire the process is
thus. After the first shot the gun is kept at the
shoulder, the muzzle slightly lowered and turned
aside to give the right hand a chance to work;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
I grasp the bolt handle, turn it up, pull it back
full length, shove it sharply home, turn it down,
and thus have reloaded. Then again I must sight
the gun, be sure not to cant it, be sure not to
have my eye too close to the cocking piece, must
get the sights right, hold steady, and squeeze. All
this on a ten seconds&#8217; average. After the fifth
shot there is a change, for the gun must be taken
from the shoulder and the fresh clip inserted.
Then five more shots at the same rate. No wonder
that, though all these days I have been hardening
my elbows and toughening my neck, at the end of
my ten shots I fell over gasping.
</p>
<p>And my luck was bad. First my clip would not
go easily into the gun, and made me feel hurried.
Next a cartridge jammed, and lost me ten seconds.
Then out of the ten cartridges four missed
fire, which put me off my aim. My coach was
ready with more, but they had to be loaded singly,
and I had time to fire only a total of eight, making
a miserable score of sixteen. The captain, after
briefly scanning my target, told me that I was
aiming too low. After another long wait I had
another chance; but this time I was thoroughly
chilled by the wind that had been blowing through
us all the afternoon. Then the worn cartridges
and the old breech mechanism behaved badly
again, and though by following the captain&#8217;s hint
I did better, making 27, it was very unsatisfactory.
The officers hope for more, and new, gallery
rifles. Without them it is difficult to give
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
us good preliminary practice. For all this, you
know, is to get us ready to shoot with the service
rifle.
</p>
<p>Many of us came shivering off the field, and
huddled in our tents with our new extra blankets
around us till we warmed up again. But very
few of the men failed to turn up at this volunteer
practice, and to stay it through on the chance of
one more round. In the whole company there
were but six who slipped away to pleasures in
the town. One of them was Randall.
</p>
<p>I am warm now, and fed. Love from

</div>

<div class='ra' style=' font-style:italic;'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>Monday the 18th September, 5.40 A. M.</p>
<p style='text-align: right; '>On my cot, while the others&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style='text-align: right; '>sit about and chat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>The reason why the others sit and chat, and
why I have time to write, is this. Young David,
fresh from his shave (which he has learned to do
at speed, and without injury, and is very proud of)
came into the tent and said: &#8220;We have ten minutes
for making up our packs before mess.&#8221;
&#8220;Lucy,&#8221; said Knudsen, &#8220;there&#8217;s a chance of
showers. Why do up packs that we may have to
undo again?&#8221; So David is polishing his shoes
(likewise a new art with him) and Pickle is sewing
on a button, and they all are talking, while elsewhere,
chiefly in the street, the men are making
up their packs for the morning&#8217;s work that is
sure to require them. And now comes in Bannister,
chanting &#8220;Soupy, soupy, soupy!&#8221; It is time
for mess.
</p>
<p>&mdash;And now, forty-five minutes later, the whole
company is at work over the packs, most of the
squads grumbling, but we very happy, for it is
showering in a dispirited way, and the order is,
&#8220;Ponchos out of the packs!&#8221; Wise Knudsen,
and fortunate Squad 8! Now the next question
is, where to carry the ponchos&mdash;in the two lower
straps of the pack? Everybody gives everybody
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
else his opinion. The word comes down the street,
&#8220;Carry them as you please.&#8221; So mine is looped
in the strap that supports my belt, and the pack
is slung. And while everyone else is adjusting
his pack, or dropping the sides of the tent near
his cot, or loosening the tent guy-ropes, I scratch
this.&mdash;Now the bugle, and the whistle, and the
last hasty running and calls, and in a moment we
shall be assembled, each with ten blank cartridges
in his belt (the first time we have had them) and
shall be off in the drizzle.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><i>Evening. In my OVERCOAT!</i></p>
</div>

<p>But it was not many minutes before our
ponchos were on, for the day was &#8220;open and
shut,&#8221; and sometimes it opened pretty wide. In
our full equipment, ponchos over everything, we
turned off the main road, went by new and strange
ways, and found ourselves for the first time on
the range, where we lined up at the 600 yards
mark. As we looked toward the butts the scene
was very picturesque.
</p>
<p>The field was level, rising at the further end to
a low ridge, below which stood the targets. These,
seen through the drizzle, were but great squares
of pale tan color, only slightly relieved against
the wet sand bank. In the middle of each of them
I could just see a black dot. Between us and
them, three hundred yards away, was extended
a dark line of men, with here and there a smoking
fire around which groups warmed themselves.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
From the thin line came irregularly spurts of
smoke, and the spattering of rifle shots. It reminded
me of an old picture of the field of Antietam,
spiritless in itself, but here made alive
by the movement, the noise, the drifting smoke,
and the gray monotone. I watched it while the
captain explained tomorrow&#8217;s work; then, glad
that today had not fallen to our lot, we marched
on, taking up our route step in the soft sand of
an old railroad bed.
</p>
<p>We were glad of our ponchos when the rain increased.
As it poured down heavily we were a
disreputable lot, all streaked with the wet, our
hats slouched, our ponchos bunched in every
direction with elbows, packs, and rifles. The
rubber turned the cold wind and shed most of
the rain; but as before, where our knees touched
the ponchos the water came through, and wet us
finely. Then the rain stopped and the clouds
became thinner, but the wind remained cold;
and when the captain slowly led us along the
specimen trenches, explaining as he went, we all
got pretty well chilled for lack of motion. I
looked at David and saw that he was turning blue.
The only mental relief came when we arrived at
the shelter where a few days ago we found Vera.
</p>
<p>Corder looked at the sign in front of it, and read
it out. &#8220;Machine gun emplacement! Very appropriate!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help smiling, nor could the rest,
except David, who for politeness tried to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
blank, and thoroughly warmed himself by the
inward struggle, turning quite red. When the
captain got us back to the road and &#8220;fell us
out&#8221; (note the idiom!) we had calisthenics, with
pushing matches that put warmth into us. And
then we marched in skirmish line through low
bushes for half a mile, till the captain lined us up
for blank cartridge practice.
</p>
<p>We had struck another part of the same abandoned
railroad, from which was plainly visible, at
perhaps two hundred yards, the gable of a deserted
shack. The captain sent to it a couple of men,
who tacked up a target on it. Then first the
coaches, our experienced riflemen, and after them
the platoons one by one, came forward, every
man being ready with his two clips of blank cartridges.
The slings were adjusted, each line as it
came up loaded with the first clip, and at the
command &#8220;Targets&mdash;up!&#8221; threw itself flat, took
position, and began to fire. The lieutenant called
out the ten second intervals. Proper firing would
bring the exhaustion of the first clip at about one
minute. Then the second clip would be inserted,
and should be finished with the second minute.
</p>
<p>I cautioned my coach to remind me to keep my
eye away from the cocking piece, and after testing
sling and ground, threw myself down and got
into position at the word. Well, it wasn&#8217;t difficult
to fire; though the noise of the gun was much
greater than that of the gallery rifle there was no
recoil; and I tried to be as steady as possible in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
aiming and squeezing. The bullseye was the silhouette,
life size, of a man lying prone and firing
at me. Instructions were to aim at the bottom
of the target, about a foot below him. The crack
of my neighbor&#8217;s piece, very loud and sharp, was
the most uncomfortable part of the performance,
and I shall shoot tomorrow with cotton in my
ears; many decided likewise. I plugged away
steadily, the ammunition worked well, and I
finished my second clip with about fifteen seconds
to spare. Then I stood up and brushed
myself, with no one to prove that I had not made
a perfect score.
</p>
<p>One hundred and fifty men shooting ten rounds
each&mdash;that meant 1500 shells left on the ground,
with 300 clips, all of brass. I noticed some rather
untidy figures, emerging from the miserable little
shacks that dotted the scrub, slinking through the
brush in our direction and gathering on the flanks
of our firing line, eight or ten men and boys and
girls, one of the latter carrying a baby. Near me
Captain Kirby cursed them under his breath as
&#8220;human buzzards,&#8221; and I understood that these
camp followers had not gathered merely to admire.
As soon as the last platoon filed off the
ground, these persons slipped forward, and began
eagerly to pick up the treasure that lay scattered
there. With brass at twenty-five cents a pound,
war prices, they made enough, scratching in the
dirt, to keep them going for the next week or so.
</p>
<p>Back to camp then, still glad of our ponchos,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
for though there was no more rain the wind was
steadily colder. Then the job of cleaning, with
one rod per squad, and patches always few, our
fouled rifles.
</p>
<p>This afternoon we were taken to a neighboring
field, where in limited area are samples of most
of the military engineering devices approved by
moderns. Three officers of the engineers in turn
took charge of us, and showed us bridges, roads,
entanglements, dugouts, rifle pits, hand grenades,
trench mortars (with real bombs!) and finally the
mysteries of map-making, which for me are practical
mysteries still. Some glimmer of an idea I
now have of how a man with a watch and compass,
a sketching board and paper, can make a working
map of country entirely new to him; but I never
could do it myself. Calisthenics next, as almost
daily; and then instead of being dismissed for our
swim, which none of us wanted in such cold, we
were marched back to the company street, where a
line soon formed at the store tent, and a magic
word was passed from squad to squad.
</p>
<p>Overcoats! Overcoats? Could we believe it?
But a figure separated itself from the crowd at
the head of the street, and came strutting toward
us. An army overcoat, o. d., and above it the
grinning features of a fellow whom we knew well.
It was true! And quickly we ourselves got into
line, coming at last to the tent, where without
considering sizes the overcoats were handed out
just as they came. After which men went up and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
down the street swapping, the little fellows with
44s calling out for 36s, and the big fellows demanding
44s. I soon exchanged my 38 for a 42, and
now, at the camp tent, am comfortably writing
in it. It holds me sweater and all, blouse too if
necessary; it can cover the ears and comes well
below the knees. Mysteriously&mdash;for I don&#8217;t understand
these things&mdash;it has the military cut.
I never felt so swell as when I first buttoned it on.
</p>
<p>There has been no general conference on account
of the cold, our captain being the only one
brisk enough to get overcoats for his men. But
company conference is now due, and I see the
captain coming. These nights on the rifle, always
the rifle.

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>We have had a long day on the rifle range, slow
fire at three hundred, five hundred, and six hundred
yards, working for a total of 50 on each target,
and a possible grand total of 250 when, some
other day, we have our two tries at rapid fire.
The work was hard for some of us, the coaches
and scorers, exciting for the rest. The captain
worked hard from first to last, trying to make it
possible for us, with our slight preparation, to
qualify as marksmen, with a total of 160, or perhaps
even to do better, as sharpshooters scoring
190, or as expert riflemen with 210 points. Our
new overcoats, for which we have him to thank,
saved the lives of many of us, for there was the
keenest little north wind blowing. I lay down in
mine once, and slept very comfortably; and all
the fellows were grateful for the protection.
There isn&#8217;t a man in the company that hasn&#8217;t
done his best today for the captain&#8217;s sake, if not
for his own.
</p>
<p>Our company were waked a little early, and
were extra prompt to breakfast, which was extra
good (eggs and bacon!)&mdash;again the captain&#8217;s
foresight. He started us promptly for the range,
surely the oddest sight that we have presented so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
far. In front went a huddle of men with benches,
chairs, and tables, lamps for blacking the sights
(lest they glitter and confuse the eye), the captain&#8217;s
megaphone, and the ammunition. We followed
at route step in our greatcoats, some of us
carrying ponchos, and except for our rifles and
belts, no other equipment. Discipline was relaxed
today, for the captain, hopeful of good
scores, was as gentle as a lamb.
</p>
<p>Of the three dozen targets we had twelve for
our share, and companies I and J used the remainder.
In front of our section of the line the
company flag was set up, the benches were placed,
the scorers took their seats, the platoons were
ranged for their turns. Companies I and J came
marching on, and before very long we were
rapidly getting used to the orderly disorder of the
range. The coaches were called up for their
opening try, and suddenly I heard the order for
the first round to begin. The shots began to rap
out, sharp and heavy.
</p>
<p>Behind each set of three targets a platoon was
stationed. The men stood and watched, or sat
and waited, or lay and tried their squeeze. Orderlies,
sergeants, and platoon commanders hurried
to and fro. Loretta came to our group and said
&#8220;Don&#8217;t stand there, men, like a flock of sheep&#8221;;
but when we paid no attention, faded away. The
Captain&#8217;s powerful voice was every few moments
heard: &#8220;Another man here on target 36. Fleming
in hospital? Then send up the next man. We
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
must waste no time.&#8221; &#8220;Ammunition here at No.
27.&#8221; &#8220;Every man ready with his score card and
his score book.&#8221; In but a few minutes the firing,
which at the first was so noticeable, became
a commonplace, yet it was worth listening to.
From along the line came scattered reports, like
the blows of a heavy rod on very heavy carpet,
now slowly separate, now close together, now
sharply double. In answer the whip-like echoes
slashed out from the woods. The drab men stood,
or sauntered, or hurried; the figures of the shooters
lay prone, each with an eager coach crouching
over him, correcting his position, urging steadiness,
repeating &#8220;Squeeze! Squeeze!&#8221; Behind the
line sat scorers at their wooden stands, behind
them the first sergeant received the records. The
company flags, marking the line beyond which
the waiting men might not advance, flapped
steadily in the breeze.
</p>
<p>And in front of all, three hundred yards away,
stood up the gray sandbank, the stopper of the
bullets. Some shots went over, to land in the
distant woods beyond, whose encircling signs
warn all wanderers to keep out. &#8220;There are
hornets in those woods today, gentlemen,&#8221; said
the captain yesterday as we passed beyond the
range. &#8220;We will keep away.&#8221; There are thirty-six
blackboards numbered in order, and between
them are the great targets of manila paper, with
their circles and the heavy spot at the centre.
As a man shoots his target sinks, its mate immediately
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
rises in the same spot, and then upon
its face appears, moved by the markers concealed
in the pit below, the record of the shot. A red
flag slowly waved&mdash;a miss!&mdash;a black cross on a
white circle, a red disk, or best of all, a white disk
that obliterates &#8220;the bull.&#8221; The scorers interpret.
&#8220;A four at three o&#8217;clock,&#8221; &#8220;a three at nine
o&#8217;clock,&#8221; &#8220;a clean five, high up,&#8221; &#8220;a nipper four at
twelve o&#8217;clock,&#8221; and with a little chuckle, &#8220;a
ricochet five!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Over it all, behind the butts, against the low
clouds, rose a silent blue hill, one of the distant
Adirondacks.
</p>
<p>In spite of our new greatcoats it grew chilly
waiting. I took my time, wrote notes of this for
you, listened, watched. At last I was called to
the bench among those whose turn was next.
There at the smoking lamp I blackened my sights,
and then carefully laying the gun on the rack I
sat down, still in my greatcoat, and while others
fidgeted with impatience, or shivered in their
sweaters, I remembered that after all I was only
a civilian, and remained calm.
</p>
<p>My name being called at last, I went forward
to the little rise where, beside a white stake, I was
to shoot. I adjusted my sling and lay down to
the left of the stake; to the right was Lucy, tense
and pale. My coach was a stranger; his was good
Clay. My coach tried in vain to get me to take
the position he preferred; it hurt and strained me,
and he gave up. As I slowly got the position I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
was used to, working my elbows into the sand,
bracing my toes, keeping my body close to the
ground, my left hand twisted in the sling and
supporting the barrel, my right at the trigger and
stock, and my cheek at the butt, to my left a
rifle heavily spoke, and in spite of cotton my ear
rang. Then Lucy shot. I heard the scorer say,
&#8220;Mr. Farnham, a miss!&#8221; and I chuckled as I
prepared to shoot.
</p>
<p>My coach knelt over me and repeated
&#8220;Squeeze!&#8221; I got the sights in line, the bull in
place above the front sight, which was&mdash;or should
have been&mdash;on a line with the top of the U of the
open sight, for I was afraid of the peep sight.
&#8220;Are you shooting on twenty-eight?&#8221; asked the
coach. I verified the number of my target, then
tried to hold the wavering muzzle steady, and
for the first time tightened my hand-grip on the
trigger of a rifle capable of killing at two miles.
It jumped sharply in my hands, I saw the red
flame at the muzzle as I heard the report, and felt
myself kicked smartly in the shoulder. Then,
spent with all this tension, I relaxed my grip and
collapsed on my face.
</p>
<p>There was a discouraging pause as I lay, waiting
to hear the hit announced. Then the scorer
cried &#8220;Mark Twenty-eight!&#8221; The man at the
field telephone repeated the order. I knew the
fact&mdash;at the butts the marker had not heard over
his head the ripping crack of the bullet, and had
to be told that I had fired. I imagined the slow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
waving of the red flag. Then I heard the scorer
briefly announce, &#8220;Mr. Godwin, miss!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Well, I shot two more shots, both on the target,
but both poor. My coach did not seem able to
help me. Then Clay, who in spite of his work
with Lucy had kept an eye on me, spoke in a low
voice to my coach, who rose and departed. In a
moment the captain came, a great relief to me,
depressed with such failure. He looked at my
score, asked a couple of questions as to my sight
and aim, took the gun and adjusted the sights,
and stayed to coach me himself.
</p>
<p>But this was not Captain Kirby of the drill
field, abrupt and peremptory. He knelt beside
me, coaxed, encouraged, purred. &#8220;Now, Mr.
Godwin, this time you will do better.&#8221; And
actually I did, a four at seven o&#8217;clock. Once more
he adjusted the sights and gave advice as to aim.
&#8220;And squeeze!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Squeeze!&#8221; I made a
five at six o&#8217;clock&mdash;only a nipper, but still a bull!
Someone else coming for him, he left me with a
&#8220;See, you&#8217;re shooting better!&#8221; And I believed
him.
</p>
<p>That is what he was doing all day, correcting,
advising, giving confidence. Every man after
shooting brought his score-book to him, and was
told how to improve his work. But it was too
late for me to make a good score on this target: I
made but twenty-two. Yet other men did worse,
nine, eleven, and even four! Corder, disgusted,
reported a twenty. Knudsen was quietly pleased
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
with his thirty-nine. Then I hunted up David,
and found him just as Randall approached with a
&#8220;Lucy, what did you make?&#8221; David acknowledged
a twenty-one, and Randall gloated over his
own forty-two. When he had gone, I said &#8220;He
ought to shoot, being pure animal. He has no
nerves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221; demanded David, meaning, &#8220;I
know he has.&#8221; But he would say no more.
</p>
<p>I found that the men with low scores were more
troubled about the effect on the company total,
and the captain&#8217;s record, than they were for their
own credit.
</p>
<p>But as for this game of shooting, it is certainly
a test of nerve. Nothing else can quite equal it&mdash;the
strain to get position, to line the sights just
right, to hold steady, and then to squeeze. By
me on the firing-line the irregular shots were loud
and startling, and people were talking and calling
all around. Golf, with its reverence for the
man about to play, is mild compared to this.
The nervous strain of firing is greater, the bodily
shock is abrupt and jarring, you have no real
chance to make up for a miss by later brilliance
or by any luck. No, golf teaches patience and it
requires poise, but&mdash;as played by the ordinary
man&mdash;it is no such game as this.
</p>
<p>And as between the experts, target shooting is
still the bigger sport. The knowledge and judgment
required to meet the varying conditions, the
steadiness demanded, the fact that the rifleman
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
is preparing himself to meet his country&#8217;s greatest
emergencies&mdash;these put golf (and you know I have
loved the game) into the lower place.
</p>
<p>I put on my greatcoat again, took the nap that
longed to be taken, and then, refreshed and more
confident, went to my next turn.
</p>
<p>This was at five hundred yards. If you will
consider that I was shooting from our house across
the meadow, across the railroad bridge, at a circle
twenty inches in diameter (about the size of our
largest pewter platter) you will understand my
task. But I was fussed to begin with, for someone
had taken my rifle from the rack, and I had
therefore not blacked the sights, nor adjusted
the sling, of the one that I hastily borrowed.
As I came to the stand I was met by an artillery
corporal, evidently a kind of super-coach, who
curtly ordered me to do the one thing and the
other, and hurried me to my place. I told him
how the captain had wanted the sights set for
this distance; I had put them so. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t
go here,&#8221; he said, readjusted them himself, and
ordered me to lie down. He was so overbearing,
and I was so uncertain of my rights, that I took
my position and fired my shot. A miss! He
blamed me severely, and in general treated me
like the dirt under my feet. At my next shot, a
poor two, he said, &#8220;There you go, thinking you
know all about it, and jerking your trigger again.&#8221;
I said, &#8220;On the contrary, I&#8217;m not used to the
pull of this trigger, and the gun went off before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
I expected.&#8221; From that time on I paid no more
attention to him, and perhaps from my manner
he saw that it was just as well to let me alone;
but he attacked the other man on this target, who
feebly protested, and who made a wretched
score. My score was coaxed along by our company
coach, a nice chap named Haynes, who was
most interested and sympathetic. As for me, the
artilleryman vexed me so that I shot to kill <i>him</i>,
and by imagining him at the target made a
thirty-six.
</p>
<p>It was an entirely new sensation, to be so bedevilled
by such a man, and to know that in wartime
I could not reply. When at noon we were
marched back to camp and dismissed I sought out
Haynes and asked, &#8220;What is your opinion of
that artillery coach?&#8221; Said he, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
speak to the captain about him.&#8221; &#8220;Thanks,&#8221; I
said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll save me the trouble.&#8221; And when
again I came back to the post in the afternoon,
though the corporal was there, he was very quiet
and good.
</p>
<p>This incident makes me doubt the value, for
such volunteers as we, of the regular non-coms
whom they hope to have here next year, if by
that time the troops are off the border. What
help could such an overbearing conceited drill-master,
with no inkling of our difficulties or our
point of view, give to such a squad as ours?
Would he last a week out of hospital, or we a
week out of arrest? No, give us a Plattsburg
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
veteran of one camp as corporal, and appoint as
sergeants those who have served two, and we
shall come on faster. Further, more men would
thus be trained for responsible positions.
</p>
<p>In the afternoon we shot at 600 yards. We
now had sandbag rests for our left hands (not for
our guns) and once more the captain showed his
foresight. He had us bring intrenching shovels
and a dozen new burlap bags, and soon we were
provided with the best sandbags on the range.
I had the same nice little Haynes who had coached
me on my second target. Unsatisfied as I still
am with my showing, I think he drilled into me
some idea of my errors, and my score again improved,
standing at forty. I feel better than if it
had wavered up and down, even if the total had
been the same, and can reasonably argue that if
the captain kept on increasing the distance, say
to 2000 yards, I should make a perfect score.
But many men, I find, did their worst at this distance,
Randall ending up at 24. Lucy has pegged
steadily along, and got into the thirties.
</p>
<p>The supper-tables buzzed tonight as never before,
every man having his tale to tell, generally a
tale of woe. Poor Knudsen is very sore, as his
last shot went into his neighbor&#8217;s bullseye, and
though the neighbor had finished shooting, the
shot could not be credited to Knudsen. There
are many other stories of misses that spoiled the
score, and on the other hand when a man has
made a ricochet hit he is not inclined to brag of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
it. Even those who from my point of view did
very well are a little inclined to grumble; and the
only really satisfied man is Percy of Squad
Nine, who holds today&#8217;s record.
</p>
<p>Concerning Knudsen&#8217;s miss, I now have the
whole story. He had as scorer an artillery sergeant
who read the flags through field-glasses, and
was an unusually long time in scoring the last shot.
At last he said &#8220;A bull,&#8221; and scored a five, which
gave Knudsen a perfect record; but he, suspecting
something, made the man admit that the
bulleye was in the wrong target. Knudsen
changed the score himself, a bit of personal
heroism that roused the wonder of Pickle, who
told me the tale, and ended &#8220;Chee, I couldn&#8217;t
a done it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Here is a story of Lieutenant Pendleton, told
me by a man who watched the incident. Our
top-sergeant was scoring badly at six hundred
yards, and the lieutenant said, &#8220;Let me try your
gun.&#8221; So he lay down, and without putting his
arm in the sling, rested the gun on the bag, drew
it tightly into the shoulder by a hand-grip of the
strap, and fired. It was a &#8220;two at one o&#8217;clock,&#8221;
which means that the shot struck the outer side
of the target about the line, on a clock face, between
one o&#8217;clock and the centre. &#8220;Your sight
is too high,&#8221; said he, and corrected it. Then he
tried again, and got a &#8220;three at three o&#8217;clock,&#8221;
which means that he struck on the level of the
bull, but still out at the right. &#8220;You must correct
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
for windage,&#8221; said he then. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give her
one and a quarter.&#8221; So once more, with the same
rest and grip, he fired. Before the targets could
be changed and the shot marked the lieutenant
got up, gave the gun to the sergeant, and walked
away, saying, &#8220;That&#8217;s a bull&#8217;s eye. You can depend
on that sighting, sergeant.&#8221; Then the scorer
called the shot. A bull&#8217;s eye it was, and the sergeant
went on to shoot a string of them.
</p>
<p>There is some pleasure in being drilled by such
men as our officers. I wish you could see the lieutenant
on parade, in his best clothes, which somehow
are more becoming to him than the undress
uniform, in which Kirby shows best. Watch
Pendleton walking with his springy, tireless step,
always with his eye on us. A dandy he is then,
but one of the fighting dandies, an athlete in good
training, and a man that knows his business.
</p>
<p>Our day was so completely taken up by the
shooting that at the end it was too late even for
Retreat, and we in the middle of our washing up
watched the other battalion at parade, stood at
attention while the band played the Star-Spangled
Banner, and saluted at the end. I have spent
much of the evening writing; and now, the first
call having blown, the camp is getting ready for
bed. In the inner company tent I am left alone,
the other letter-writers and diarists having drifted
away. In the outer, open tent, where the conferences
are held, three men are sitting at a corner
of the big table, still discussing their scores, their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
rifles, the squeeze, the kick, the serious mistake
it is to cant the gun. And here is a fact for you.
Captain Kirby declares that the rifles do not
kick, and in his own case he is probably right.
But I got today a very sharp recoil each time I
fired, so that by noon my arm was lame to the
elbow, and my shoulder sore. I expected much
difficulty in the afternoon, and the first shot hurt
consumedly; but whether or not I learned to hold
the rifle better, or whether the gradual toning up
of my muscles is accustoming me to what comes,
the rest of the kicks seemed to act as a sort of
massage, so that I forgot about them, and tonight
I am entirely free of lameness.
</p>
<p>Outside, at the head of the company street, the
fire is gradually dying down. Wood is always
provided for it, a hole is dug, the men feed it as
long as they please, and in the morning the police
squad, I suppose, smooth the ground. On benches
or on the ground the men sit about the fire, sing,
discuss, or chat in groups. There is in the store
tent an easy chair made of rough lumber and
sacking; when the captain can be induced to stay
after conference the men bring it out, seat him
in it, and make him talk. On his own doings he
is silent, but on the work of the camp, the formations,
drill, skirmish work, patrolling, outpost
duty, and especially just now the ways of his beloved
tool, the rifle, he has much to say. Around
him are men often much older than he, others who
in civil life command several times his pay, fellows
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
who have every luxury at command, as well
as chaps bred and indeed wedded to the most
peaceable pursuits. But they all are here for a
purpose; they never talk patriotism but they all
act it; and everything he can tell them that bears
on their efficiency as soldiers they will pump
from him if they possibly can. It is fine to see
how they recognize in him complete mastery of
the subject that occupies us all, and how they sit
at his feet for instruction.
</p>
<p>But he has left us nearly half an hour ago, and
the groups that remain are slowly separating, as
one by one the men go to their tents. I can tell
you just what is happening in ours. The lantern
is lighted and hanging on the pole. Clay is probably
finishing a letter to his &#8220;mother.&#8221; Bannister
is doubtless already abed, but ready from
his cot to add a sleepy jest to the quiet talk that
is slowly going on. Reardon is putting the last
stamps on the sheaf of post-cards that he daily
sends, for he, you must understand, has more
correspondents at home than any of the rest of
us. Rather big and burly, the quietest of men,
with a very active eye but very intensely committed
to the minding of his own business, I know
him to be the most popular man in his own little
town, where as the managing clerk of the grocery
he knows every man, woman, and child in the
place. He knows the taste of each, what he habitually
needs or demands, whether to trust or require
cash. He gets through his day without a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
clash with anyone. And knowing both his customers
and the market he looks after the needs of
the town, warns of a rise in prices, calls attention
to special bargains, advises to lay in a stock of
this or that. They miss him now that he&#8217;s gone;
I know it by the pleasure he takes in the letters
and post-cards that come daily, bits from which he
cannot help reading out to us&mdash;from the Civil
War veteran who half believes in Plattsburg, and
half doesn&#8217;t; the drug-store clerk that has to go
off on his vacation alone; the &#8220;boss&#8221; that has
nothing personal to say, but quotes the market
changes; the neighbor who doesn&#8217;t quite venture
to trust to the post the doughnuts she wishes she
might send. And nightly Reardon sits on his cot
and writes in the dim light careful answers to
every message.
</p>
<p>Lucy and Corder are putting themselves to bed
most systematically, Corder because of his middle-aged
habit, Lucy on account of that aristocratic
cleanliness in which he has been scrupulously
bred. They have their system and their order,
the toilet, the costume, the making of the bed, all
very careful and precise. Knudsen, still dressed,
is lolling on his cot and jollying; this is the time of
day when he most comes out of himself, and I
know that presently when I approach the tent
it will be his ringing tenor that I shall hear. He
is poking fun at the others, cursing that last shot
on the range, interrupting Reardon and Clay in
their writing, philosophizing on his favorite subject,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
baseball. Yet if you get a little closer to
him you find that he has interests that it takes
a little coaxing to disclose: religious convictions
that he has changed with his growth, curious hard
business experiences that make him declare that
he is a self-seeker, while you have only to watch
him with Lucy to know that he is not. Yet he
sedulously knocks and batters at every feminine
quality that the boy discloses, and will exaggerate
any statement if he thinks you suspect him
of tenderness.
</p>
<p>I shall presently make a dash, for the tent,
snatch my tooth-brush and make for the spigot,
and bring back a basin of water for my feet.
Then Knudsen will bestir himself and race me for
bed, at the same time that Reardon lays by his
pen and accepts our warning. We crawl between
the blankets, nine over us tonight. I shall put
my poncho over me next, and my overcoat on
that, and with the tent-wall looped up shall be
practically outdoors.
</p>
<p>Last of all Pickle will come slipping in from some
rendezvous with friends. He sleeps in his clothes,
minus shoes and leggings, and he is likely to be
curled up before I am.
</p>
<p>And then float to us the notes of Taps. &#8220;Love,
good night. Must thou go...?&#8221; It is the signal.
The last one of us puts out the lantern, and it is
soon &#8220;Good night, boys,&#8221; and silence. Usually I
go to sleep at once; if not I soon hear the feet of
two of the sergeants in the street and see the gleam
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
of their lantern. They come from tent to tent,
enter ours and throw the light on each cot, and
pass on. Often I hear from the neighboring tents
a sleepy &#8220;Good night, sergeant,&#8221; but never yet
the question &#8220;Who sleeps in that cot?&#8221; A high
average, then, of obedience to the rules. The
men are here for business.
</p>
<p>I have lingered almost too long. Good night!

<p>It promises today, Wednesday, to be showery
once more, so we are making up our packs with
the ponchos out, ready for use. Post-mortems of
yesterday&#8217;s scores are still going on. The boys
are all well and lively, except that I have just
passed Randall standing gloomy at the door of
his tent, feeling very much insulted because someone
at breakfast called him a grabber. Apart
from him the street is humming with talk, as the
boys make up their packs upon the hard-trodden
sand.
</p>
<p>It is a very amusing thing, this confusion and
talk of the street, as men on errands make their
way among the kneeling figures, the police squad
tries to do its work, the sergeants pass, and jokes
or criticism are bandied about. We are becoming
very well acquainted, except for those who have
not the habit of noticing their neighbors. There
are a couple of men who have for ten days sat
opposite me at table, and yet do not know me
when we meet outside. But most of the men are
very companionable. Nevertheless, it must be
admitted that the opportunity has not been very
great. Unless a man is Number One or Number
Four in his squad, he is likely to be swallowed up
by it. I have felt very fortunate to be Number
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
One, for in all formations in line I stand beside a
man of another squad, and whenever we fall in
or stand at rest I chat with them. Since Bannister
has neglected the advice, given by the captain,
to shift the men about, I am glad that I
have had this advantage, and am more lucky in
getting a wider acquaintance than is possible to
some of the others. For as you have seen, we eat
together, march together, dress and sleep together,
the squad being the unit on which everything is
based. Captain Kirby has said that when we
rest on the hike squads must sit down together,
so as to waste no time in falling in.
</p>
<p>But the shooting has done a great deal to
break down this isolation. It was impossible, on
the range or the gallery, to keep the squads together,
whether in shooting or in waiting. The
men compared their scores, explained their mistakes,
gave advice, and fished for sympathy,
with everyone they met. Men in squads widely
separated in the line got quite chummy over their
misfortunes, and grew friendly in encouraging each
other. The scorers and especially the coaches met
many new men. So at the table and the camp-fire
the talk is now much more personal, and I
think that from this time on the company will be
more of a unit in feeling, if not more in unison in
drill.
</p>
<p>On this last point Captain Kirby is certainly
unanimous. The shooting, with its necessary
disorder, has got us out of our habits of snap,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
and today we have been put through a course of
sprouts that has taken away any conceit that we
might have had. This morning he gave us ten
rounds of blank cartridges and took us out into
our usual ground, the Peru road and the fields
adjoining. First, in anticipation of tomorrow,
by platoons we were given rapid-fire practice,
sitting and firing our ten shots at a count of
ninety seconds. To our delight, it being a little
windy, the big paper target had to be held by a
couple of the sergeants, one of them being Loretta,
at whom most of us aimed. (Some day I shall
find time to tell you about him.) This practice
was valuable to me, helping me with my squeeze.
It was amusing to watch the other men fire (cool
and clever, or nervous and clumsy) and to listen
to a little echo close behind our backs as we
waited, like a bunch of firecrackers going off all
by itself.
</p>
<p>And an incident. Before leaving the ground I
gathered up ten shells and some clips, to practice
with at camp. After Recall I went to the end
of the company street, made up my clips, and
had nearly finished simulating the shooting of
the second one, when we were called for calisthenics,
and I came running, and put away the
gun. When later we fell in for parade, and were
given &#8220;Inspection arms!&#8221; on my opening my rifle
a shell flew out, right at the feet of the first sergeant,
much to my disgust. When later still I
came back and found it, I discovered it to be not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
an &#8220;empty&#8221; but a &#8220;blank,&#8221; which someone this
morning must excitedly have pumped out of his
gun unfired, and left lying for me to pick up.
Lucky I didn&#8217;t fire it in practising at the foot of
the street!
</p>
<p>But it shows that I am still a greenhorn if I
will put away my gun with anything in it, even
though I had supposed it to contain but an empty
shell. I don&#8217;t intend ever to do such a thing
again. There is another trifling mistake we are
liable to, as illustrated today. Halted at &#8220;company
front,&#8221; that is, with the two ranks in long
lines, the captain ordered us to load. At the command
the men half turn to the right, but keep
the rifle pointing forward and up; the rear rank
men also come close to the front, so that the muzzles
of their guns are in advance of the front rank
men. Standing thus they open the breeches of
their guns, thrust in the clips, shove the bolt
handle forward and turn it down&mdash;and then
somebody&#8217;s gun goes off! So you see why the
rear rank men have their guns where no one will
be hit, and why the captain stands off at one side.
My, but he read us a lecture this morning! &#8220;Who
let off that gun?&mdash;Mr. So-and-so, some blunders
are crimes. That was one!&#8221; And a few more
well chosen words. One hundred and forty-nine
of us were glad we hadn&#8217;t made that little slip.
</p>
<p>After our firing the captain broke the company
into two, and took my half himself. Then he
proved to us that in skirmish drill we had forgotten
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
all we had ever known, briefly expressed
his opinion of the corporals, and splitting us into
squads, told the sub-squad-leaders to take command.
Now Reardon, who has drilled at Number
Four in the rear rank since the formation of the
squad, is by virtue of that position the corporal&#8217;s
substitute, and he manfully tried to lead us. I
saw in a moment, first that he knew twice as
much as I about the drill regulations, second that
never before having given an order, he could not
do himself justice. Further, with the captain in
that mood every man of us was scared. So presently
the captain, after a few beheadings in other
squads, came and watched ours for a minute,
sent Reardon to his place in the ranks, and as his
eye roved over the rest of us, picked me out,
probably as being the only one whose name he
knew. &#8220;Mr. Godwin, put the squad through the
skirmish drill!&#8221; A bad five minutes! I can order
men about <i>informally</i>, and I knew what I wanted
done in this case, but to give the order in the precise
words of the drill book was more than my
memory could compass. It was very interesting,
even quite exciting; continually I racked my brain
for something to do next in which I should not
make a fool of myself. We got back into company
formation after a while, and the captain tried
the line in a skirmish advance; then abruptly he
put all the corporals back into their places, and
my little reign was over.
</p>
<p>I should like, as anyone would like, to be corporal.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
Yet I should not make a good one, being
nowadays in an absent-minded state and likely
to fall into fits of brooding from which I could not
give my orders correctly or promptly. I wonder
if the captain will find out Knudsen. But it is
right that Bannister should remain corporal, for
he is daily improving in the work.
</p>
<p>Nor can it be at all easy for our two officers to
find, in the midst of all their work and among so
many men, the one man in every eight capable
of leading the squad. In the early stage of the
school of the soldier it was not difficult to find
those men who could best handle their guns and
drill others in the same simple art. But such a
test, even if mentally sufficient, does not take in
the moral qualities necessary for the handling of
eight men, keeping them up to discipline, seeing
that they understand and are at all times ready
for their work. Experienced sergeants might
make this quickly possible, but our sergeants,
even when they have been here before, are mostly
very new to their duties. I take it that the captain
and lieutenant are doing as well as they
can.
</p>
<p>In the afternoon the captain formed us in the
street and drilled us in the manual, then took us
down on the field and explained battalion parade,
after which he put us through and through and
through its simple evolutions, we blundering all
the time. We had merely to march in line, to
march in column, to halt and bring our rifles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
down together, and to do the customary movements
of the manual in unison. But try as we
might, we couldn&#8217;t please the captain. For my
part, I was as scared as a schoolboy, fearing to
make some slip. But such little ones as I know I
made passed unnoticed; in fact, our part of the
line attracts very little of his attention, so I conclude
we do fairly well. Yet in the picture which
I send, of the captain looking at our squad as
we march company front, the camera has caught
Squad 8 in a great mistake. The sun, as it lies
exactly along the line of the company, with only
the right hands and knees in full light, shows my
part of the line pushed wholly forward out of the
shadow, and the Captain looking at us in disgust.
His attitude shows his fighting quality.
&#8220;The scrappiest captain in the army,&#8221; says Knudsen.
So often he has to look back thus and
warn us: &#8220;Steady!&#8221; or &#8220;Guide!&#8221; or &#8220;Hold back
on the left!&#8221;
</p>
<p>How little you as a spectator would get of what
goes on in the ranks on such an occasion as today&#8217;s
final parade! Suppose you were where I
so often wish you, at the top of the slope above the
field, which in spite of certain unevennesses would
look to you fairly level. You would see the band
march down and take its place in the left corner;
then away to your right the companies would appear
in their separate columns, and perhaps you
would think they were very interesting as they
halted and waited. Then when the major came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
and took his stand below you, the music would
strike up, and the three companies would march
straight onto the field, along the bottom of which
they would one after another swing into line and
stand in apparently beautiful order. Then an
adjutant with a clear high voice would give orders,
and the men would present arms, come to
attention, and then to parade rest. In this position
they would remain while the band, playing
a march, would go down the whole line and back
again, the music, when they were once more in
place, abruptly stopping. Then the officers would
gather and march forward in line, they would return,
the major would call a command, and the
companies would all break into squads, the rifles
coming to the shoulders. To the right they would
pass, turn up the slope, and then one by one
would again swing into line and pass, with more
or less beautifully wavering fronts, before the
major. The first two companies would evoke
applause from the spectators; the third, in which
you would see a familiar face, would rouse none&mdash;and
though you might clap your best, in this case
you are but a ghost, and no one would hear you.
Then the companies would for last time break
into squads and so would march off the field.
And you would sigh and think, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it fine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Well, you would never get the true inwardness
unless I told you. It went this way.
</p>
<p>Down out of the street we marched into the
field, I a small part of a big machine, very much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
afraid that I might make some blunder. The
men&#8217;s feet thudded in unison on the sod, and to
each tramp came the rustling echo of our stiff
breeches, always an accompaniment to us as we
march in good order. We waited, we marched
forward to the music, we heard the captain give
his first order&mdash;to the guides, I realized, not to
us&mdash;but then came &#8220;Squads left&mdash;march!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I swung to the left, the men in front of me
marched to the right. Just grazing the last of
them, as these rear-rank men filed to their places,
I stepped into my position in the front rank just
as the corporal finished counting &#8220;Six&#8221; below
his breath, and at &#8220;Seven!&#8221; the whole line, which
had been waiting for us Number Ones to complete
it, strode straight forward. &#8220;Company&mdash;!&#8221;
and we took this last moment, each out of the
corner of his eye searching to the right, to get in
good line. &#8220;Halt!&#8221; Low voices counted &#8220;One,
two!&#8221; and the halt was completed. &#8220;One, two,
three!&#8221; and the pieces were at the order. The
captain commanded &#8220;Right&mdash;dress!&#8221; and we
edged forward, our heads turned to the right, to
align the rank.
</p>
<p>Such eager work we make of it&mdash;&#8220;Forward on
the right&mdash;back in the next squad&mdash;Frothingham,
you&#8217;re too far forward&mdash;tell Neary to get
back!&#8221; Such commands, all under the breath,
run up and down the line. At last we are in place,
the Captain says &#8220;Front!&#8221; and takes his place
before the middle of the line, facing away from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
us. But he says in reminder, &#8220;The next command
for <i>you</i> will be Parade Rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alas, Lieutenant Pendleton&#8217;s high tenor (he is
the adjutant for the day) calls &#8220;Guides&mdash;posts!&#8221;
We knew&mdash;we ought to have known&mdash;the order;
we had been warned to ignore it. But some of
the men come to parade rest. The captain hears,
though he cannot turn to look. &#8220;Stupid!&#8221; he
hisses. &#8220;As you were!&#8221; Then comes the command
for us all, &#8220;Parade&mdash;rest!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was very comfortable, waiting while the band
marched up and down. We were not much
stirred by this; we knew by heart all the few
tunes; we thought the drum-major very tiresome
with his bent head and his elbow jogging for the
time. But there was, above the ugly mess-shacks
straight in front, the finest sunset to look
at: angry clouds to the right, to the left wide
reaches of pure blue, with tiny white clouds
stretching in rank to infinite distance, and in the
middle the yellow glow of fire behind broken
masses, through which shot, not beams of light,
but rather, it seemed, wide bars of shadow.
</p>
<p>The captain, as we thus stood at parade, hissed
back over his shoulder, &#8220;Bad! Some of you men
have your feet too far back.&#8221; This would particularly
disgust him, for at previous practice,
taking a gun from a sergeant, he stood in front
of us and said, &#8220;Let me show you how Rip Van
Winkle here in the second squad comes to parade
rest,&#8221; and gave us a ludicrous example of slowness
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
and slovenliness. Then he illustrated, in briskness
and correct position, just how we should
do it.
</p>
<p>Returned to his place after saluting the major,
he said, looking straight in front, &#8220;Your next
command is Squads Right.&#8221; The major&#8217;s big
voice boomed: &#8220;Pass in review&mdash;squads right&mdash;March!&#8221;
I turned sharply to my right, marked
time, and when the other three had come into
line, together we stepped out. The band blared
out, we were in step, and so approached the corner.
&#8220;Column left!&#8221; and we did our best to turn
correctly, though nobody could see. Then we
marched up the slope, knowing that the real test
was now coming. &#8220;Squads left!&#8221; and as the rear
rank man made way for me, I stepped into place,
and in one line we all strode out together. To hold
the line straight! You on the top of the slope
may have cried &#8220;How pretty!&#8221; at the rifles all
with the same slant, the hands at the same height,
the heads straight front, the feet&mdash;one, two!
one, two!&mdash;in perfect time with the music. But
with us in the line there was intentness to remedy
any unevenness, strain to hold ourselves just
right. We could not look except out of the corners
of the eyes; all was done by the touch of the elbows.
For a few yards, rods, it was good. We
safely crossed a slimy patch where a great puddle
had just dried, through which on Monday I
tramped ankle deep, and where now a fall would
be natural. Then&mdash;ah! we expected this! Frothingham,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
I, Knudsen, found ourselves marching
alone, the other men out of touch with us, having
drawn away to the right and left. I heard my
mates grumble, I knew what I was to do: spread
myself to occupy all possible space and march
straight onward, for&mdash;there! they were back
again, surging from the left and right, back in
their proper places, and the line had not really
broken. &#8220;Good!&#8221; murmurs Knudsen. &#8220;Hold
it!&#8221; exhorts the captain over his shoulder. Then
&#8220;Eyes right!&#8221; and thus saluting as we passed
the major we could see, or thought we saw, a
perfect line. &#8220;Front!&#8221; We swept on; we listened.
The ladies had clapped the first two
companies, but there was no applause for us.
Had it then been bad after all?
</p>
<p>Back to the street we marched, and formed in
line. Lieutenant Pendleton came and spoke to
the captain, then walked away smiling. &#8220;The
lieutenant says you did well,&#8221; said the captain
briefly. But he was so short that we thought him
grumpy, especially since the lieutenant had never
before been seen to give us anything else than his
little ironical smile. Yet at company conference,
in the evening, one of us ventured to ask the captain
if we really had done badly. &#8220;No,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;I was pleased with you. You did well. The
major said you did best.&#8221; So the lack of applause
meant nothing. I saw men whose home affairs
are so large that this might properly be small to
them, look at each other in relief.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>Today I got a letter from Walt Farnham about
his cousin Lucy. He says: &#8220;I know you won&#8217;t
baby him. The camp ought to do him good. It
was I that put the idea into his head, but his
father, afraid that he might back out at the last
minute, or not stick it through, has promised him
an auto of his own when he gets back, anything
up to twelve thousand dollars. How can even
Plattsburg save such a boy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Vera is after him now. After conference
I was writing in the company tent, the inner one,
while the captain still talked outside to half a
dozen men. To my surprise a bell rang behind
me, and while I sat looking at a curious instrument
on the post, wondering if it were a telephone,
the captain came in, took from it a strange receiver-transmitter,
and spoke into it. I heard
Vera plainly answering, and the captain, saying
&#8220;Mr. Godwin is right here,&#8221; gave me the thing to
hold. She said &#8220;Oh, Dick!&#8221; so plainly that of
course the captain heard it as he went out again.
Vera told me that Mrs. Farnham has written her,
asking her to keep an eye on her darling, and I was
to send Lucy to call. I warned her she&#8217;d much
better leave him alone, but she laughed and insisted.
The telephone was in that state, or she
spoke so plainly (you know how it occasionally
happens) that anyone could have heard her even
in the outer tent. When I hung up and went
out, there was the captain just saying good night
to the men, and the table and benches would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
not let me slip by before he turned and saw
me.
</p>
<p>You know there are moments when eyes meet
and seem to catch, and it is difficult to pass without
speaking. That is why, I am sure, the captain
said: &#8220;You are very well acquainted with
Miss Wadsworth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I thought that here was a chance for the truth.
&#8220;I ought to be,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I have been engaged
to her for the past two years.&#8221; And then seeing,
by the instant change in his face to one of deepest
gravity, what he supposed me to mean, I
added, &#8220;She broke the engagement a month
ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said he, not relieved, mother, or not
showing relief, but very seriously kind, &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry, Mr. Godwin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, captain,&#8221; I said, and got myself
away. I don&#8217;t mind having told; indeed I did it
deliberately, quite for the good of his peace of
mind. It&#8217;s always a relief to strike one rival off
the list, and if ever he gets really interested in
Vera he&#8217;ll find plenty of others blocking the way.
</p>
<p>When I gave David Vera&#8217;s message he flushed
up at first with pleasure, then remembered that
an evening call would spoil a company conference,
which he has taken to attending. As usual,
he looked to Knudsen for advice, and that wily
person said, &#8220;Go in the afternoon and perhaps
you&#8217;ll miss her,&#8221; which relieved the boy considerably.
Our time is too horribly full for social calls.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>Tomorrow evening there is to be a company boxing
match, one-minute rounds, no decision given.
It is said that Randall has entered, and Pickle
remarked thereupon, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to have the laying
of him out.&#8221; &#8220;No fear,&#8221; said Corder. &#8220;Randall
is to box a man he knows, for points only,
very gently.&#8221; &#8220;Yellow,&#8221; said Clay. Lucy said
nothing, but looked a good deal. There actually
are coming lines of firmness around his mouth.
</p>
<p>Good-by.

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>I am writing at about 7.30 o&#8217;clock on the range,
after having fired my practice shots to make my
sighting sure, and now with time to wait before
my rapid-fire test. Imagine the usual confusion,
the heavy rapping of the shots, the calling over
of names, and the buzz and laughter of the men
waiting near me. A perfect morning, the dew
just burning off, a little breeze from the lake, and
not a cloud in the sky.
</p>
<p>We are shooting from the two hundred yard
mark, sitting position, and since I have watched
a few rounds, I am able to tell you the way of it.&mdash;As
the guns become silent with the disappearance
of the targets the Lieutenant calls, &#8220;Next
men up!&#8221; Those who have just shot rise and
nervously stand aside, to watch the scoring of
their ten shots. The new men, while loading and
locking their pieces, also watch the record of their
predecessors. Passing behind D Company a few
minutes ago, I saw the flag cross one target six
times. I did not see the beginning of the score,
and how many more misses the poor devil made,
I can only guess. The men go away with their
scores, the new ones stand waiting.
</p>
<p>From the left rings the high call, &#8220;Ready on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
the right!&#8221; The lieutenant responds to his men,
&#8220;Unlock your pieces.&#8221; To the waiting men the
interval is long. Then slowly the blank targets
begin to sink and the tops of the true ones to rise.
It is the signal. The men drop to the sitting
position and settle the butts in their shoulders;
the muzzles rise, waver, and steady. Then together
&#8220;Pol-lop!&#8221; and the whole line, faster and
faster, bursts into the rap-rap-rapping of the
continued fire. Along the line, little spurts of
flame; a thin haze rises from the muzzles and at
once disappears. Beside each shooter kneel two
coaches, one calling the time, the other exhorting,
warning, entreating. A distinct lag in the firing
between forty-five and fifty seconds&mdash;the men
are loading their second clips. Then the fire
gradually quickens to the full rate, the coaches
urging the slow ones on, holding the hasty ones
back. The fire slackens, and seems stopped,
when as the targets sink at the ninety seconds,
two last hasty shots slap out. The round is over.
In the brief time the three dozen men have fired
three hundred and sixty shots.
</p>
<p>(<i>Later.</i>) My turn approached, and I stood
waiting, the sling clasped on my arm. I felt the
strain of the long wait before there came the call,
Ready! To my coaches I had said&mdash;to one,
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let me shoot too fast, and keep me on
<i>my</i> target&#8221;; to the other, &#8220;Remind me to squeeze.&#8221;
Then the blank target, beside the great 28, began
to sink, and down I dropped. I was not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
nervous now; at least I did not tremble. I tried
to fire slow, to squeeze, to keep on my own target,
(for truly, as the captain lately said, firing on
another man&#8217;s target is one of the sad things of
life.) My second clip I had to shoot quicker until
my last shot, when the coach said, &#8220;Plenty of
time.&#8221; So I sighted and squeezed my best, felt
that I could call the bullseye, and pulling out the
bolt for the last time, to show that the breech
and magazine were empty, stood up and stepped
back. Now for the score.
</p>
<p>The target rose at last. The red disk was all
I hoped for, but there came the white, again the
white, again the white, again, again, again, then
three times the red, and once the black. I still
waited, having lost count. Would the flag come
now? But no, the target sank, and my coaches
congratulated me on a forty-five!
</p>
<p>(<i>Evening. In the tent.</i>) Well, I won&#8217;t put in
too much detail for you, to whom perhaps this
shooting has no interest. We finished at two
hundred yards and moved back, carrying benches,
racks, chairs, flags, everything, and began over
again at three hundred yards, prone. The men
were mostly very much on the stretch, and I admit
that I was, for while I now was practically
sure of my grade of marksman, I might, by shooting
especially well, even become a sharpshooter.
Lucy was in a similar state, marksman being
within his grasp. Randall was swaggering; he
had been shooting well. But Knudsen was very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
anxious, surprising in so cool a fellow. &#8220;To be
Expert,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to make a fifty.
Confound it, I&#8217;m afraid that shot I sent into the
wrong target will ruin my chances. I need the
little leeway it would give.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Well, he missed it by two, and that little error
undid him. Lucy got his grade of marksman,
and his excitement was delightful. He sought
out each member of the squad and called for congratulations.
How disgusted his mother would
be to see him with his hand on Pickle&#8217;s shoulder,
discussing the score, for really, don&#8217;t you know,
socially Pickle is less than nobody! I made my
grade as sharpshooter, just made it, with a forty-nine.
</p>
<p>Poor Reardon! His scores had not been good,
only a miracle could make him marksman, but
he lost his chance. Loretta&mdash;
</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you about Loretta, a sergeant whom
the boys have nicknamed thus. Luckily he is
not in our platoon; but we soon got to know the
lofty smile with which he passed up and down
the street, and his contempt for the enlisted man.
Such, my dear mother, is the inflating power of a
little authority.
</p>
<p>Well, he has been very busy with the shooting,
making a good record himself, and helping, as
all the sergeants did, with the scoring. Needing
a scorer at one of the targets, he took poor Reardon
and put him at work just when his last turn was
coming on, and in spite of the fact that he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
already served long hours at the job. Reardon
protested, Loretta promised to let him have his
turn, but when the shooting was all over there
was poor Reardon still at the desk, and his last
round was not fired. We noticed that on the
way back to camp he was very silent and cast
down, but we did not know why till we were
cleaning our guns in the tent, all the racks being
occupied outside. Then I questioned Reardon,
and the facts came out.
</p>
<p>All of us were wrathy, but you should have seen
Lucy! Tears of anger came into his eyes as he
started up. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go at once and tell the captain!&#8221;
Reardon clutched him. &#8220;No,&#8221; said the
good fellow. &#8220;I hadn&#8217;t a chance to qualify. It&#8217;s
perfectly true. Loretta told me so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Loretta told you so!&#8221; echoed David. He was
quite white and shaking at this instance of adding
insult to injury. &#8220;By God!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was for going at once and complaining, but
Reardon wouldn&#8217;t let him. &#8220;Then,&#8221; said David,
&#8220;wait till the hike. If you don&#8217;t get even with
him then, I will!&#8221;
</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t tell this story to David&#8217;s mother.
She might think her son too sympathetic with
an &#8220;outsider.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The fellows have been in the habit of cooing at
Loretta as he passes their tents. His pet name
precedes him down the street, the coos come from
the shadowed interiors. It has been meant
harmlessly. But this story of Reardon has spread
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
rapidly, and I thought I detected a snarl in the
cooing when Loretta just went by. There is
something in David&#8217;s threat. Wait till the
hike!
</p>
<p>This afternoon we had our usual drill and calisthenics,
after which I went swimming in the lake,
as I do daily, though under certain difficulties.
The beach is very stony and bruises the feet, and
the piers that have been built at our two bathing
places are quite inadequate, both as accommodating
too few men at a time, and next as not going
out into deep water. Perhaps early in the summer
the water at the ends may be up to one&#8217;s
shoulders, but now it is scarcely above the waist,
and none but the cleverest and most venturesome
dare to dive. So many would like the diving that
it is a pity that a little money can&#8217;t be expended
here. However, the water is fine, even if it is
now getting so cold that some of the men are
giving up their swim. We often have surf here,
when the southeast wind quarters across the bay
all the way from Burlington, and then the fun is
notable.
</p>
<p>The scene at the foot of the pier particularly
struck me today, after the men were out. There
were nearly a hundred of them in a rather narrow
compass, so close to each other, on the boulders
of the beach, that they reminded me of the pictures
one sees of big birds in their colonies. The
men were naked, and every one in active motion,
rubbing down. The sight of so much brown and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
pink skin, of so many moving bodies and arms
and legs, was most peculiar and amusing.
</p>
<p>The list of company officers has been published.
Two of our best sergeants becoming lieutenants,
other sergeants have been named, and the list of
corporals and sub-squad-leaders has been fixed.
In our squad Bannister and Reardon stand as
before. Ban quietly told us that he was glad to
get the appointment. &#8220;I had my eye on you,&#8221;
he said to Knudsen, &#8220;and on you,&#8221; to me.
&#8220;This will please my old father: he was a corporal
in the Civil War.&#8221; And good Ban forgot
us as he thought of the satisfaction of the old
man at home.
</p>
<p>Tonight at conference we were given definite
details of the scheme for reimbursing us for our
travelling expenses and our mess. The government
will repay those who take the oath of allegiance&mdash;and
everyone is hunting for the nigger
in the woodpile. There is so general a sentiment
that the War Department tricked the militia
into taking the oath of six years&#8217; service before
starting for Texas, that none of us cares to be
caught promising too much. But I feel that the
form of oath, which was read aloud tonight, is
pretty straightforward. We enlist only for the
period of the camp, and for instruction only. I
shall take the oath. If before the period is over
the government takes us away for service anywhere,
I suppose there will be an emergency to
justify it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>We were also given additional facts regarding
the hike. Having so small a regiment, yet having
the baggage train of the large August camp, we
are to go on the longest hike yet, eleven days on
the road and in the field, ten nights in the pup-tents.
We are sorting our belongings to take or
to leave, and David is wondering how he can carry
all his exquisite appointments.
</p>
<p>But he has just come out strong. Company
conference being over, there was held the boxing
match which one of the sergeants has been promoting,
and the whole company (officers discreetly
absent) formed the ring and applauded
the heroism. Much of it would not interest you,
yet you could have stood a glimpse of it&mdash;the
circle of men, good-naturedly applauding, the
heavy shadows under the overhead light, the gray-green
uniformity of men and sand, the two dancing
figures, and the pat-pat of the gloves. There
were some neat bouts, and then the promoter
made an announcement, which to my surprise I
saw Randall, stripped to the waist, furtively trying
to stop.
</p>
<p>He had on his left, said the sergeant, one
remaining contestant, whose opponent had just
sent word that he had hurt his wrist. Would any
gentleman be willing to provide Mr. Randall with
an antagonist?
</p>
<p>No one came forward. Randall looked very
formidable, with his handsome features and also
a most superb set of muscles. I was saying to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
myself that perhaps I&#8217;d better give him a go,
when I caught sight of Lucy&#8217;s face, peering between
the men in front of him, and so plainly full
of desire that I waited. Then Corder, on the
other side of him, jogged David in the ribs, and
said in a low voice, &#8220;He called you Lucy!&#8221; In
an instant David, without a look behind or a
moment&#8217;s hesitation, was pushing through the
ring. &#8220;Let me try.&#8221; And he stepped out into
the light.
</p>
<p>Someone caught me by the arm, and there was
Knudsen, very angry. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you stop
him?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;He never can stand up to
that fellow.&#8221; But I, feeling quite as satisfied as
ever I felt in my life, smiled him down, &#8220;Somehow
I think he can,&#8221; said I, and pushed after
David, to act as his second.
</p>
<p>Oh, I coached him all I could, and in the rests
I helped the gasping boy in every way I knew
how. The rounds were short, but too long for him
in his still soft condition. And he knew so little
of the game! Had Randall, who really had boxed
before, used his head, poor David would have
stood no chance whatever. Yet the boy&#8217;s insight
was correct. No sooner did Randall see before
him the lad&#8217;s unmistakably eager face, and know
from David&#8217;s first rush that here was a fight, than
he was flustered. So as boxing the bout was nothing:
neither could hit clean, parries were clumsy,
much was accident. David&#8217;s very ardor betrayed
him, and he came back to me at the end of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
each round quite winded. But for the rest, nothing
could be finer. Randall was twenty pounds
the heavier, and slight David staggered when the
blows came home, yet always he came back. His
panting persistence, his determination to strike,
were too much for the other. He held back, and
David came on; he drew aside, and David followed
him; he struck, and David without parrying
came right through, and landed blow after
blow somewhere.
</p>
<p>The men were yelling presently, here was so
evidently grit against mere muscle, spirit against
flesh. Randall grew angry and hit hard, but he
was wild; he grew afraid and tried to clinch, but
his rush was feeble. David jabbed him repeatedly
in the ribs, drew off, and for the first time
in the three rounds (the referee was just calling
time) hit Randall neatly&mdash;on the nose.
</p>
<p>And Randall, in pain but not hurt (for the boy
couldn&#8217;t hit hard) nevertheless believed himself
finished. I think he wanted to stagger and fall
at full length, but he only succeeded in sitting
down. Shout upon shout upon shout! Then we
of the squad took David, groggy with his own efforts,
rubbed him and fanned him and swabbed
him, and finally walked him off between us.
</p>
<p>Knudsen said in my ear, &#8220;You were right.
That was worth a thousand dollars.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A fellow from another squad tried to be complimentary.
&#8220;Well done, Lucy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pickle, without any ceremony, pushed in between.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
&#8220;Cut that out! His name is Farnham.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The chap was puzzled. &#8220;But you don&#8217;t call
him that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We know him better now,&#8221; said Pickle. &#8220;We
call him David.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And David, who had been leaning heavily on
me, at the words stood upright. He had been
smiling with satisfaction; now he looked happy.
He put his arm over Pickle&#8217;s shoulder as the other
fellow walked away. &#8220;Thanks, Pick, old man,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>Knudsen and Corder and I fell behind and
shook hands. The name Lucy was dead and
buried.
</p>
<p>David wouldn&#8217;t go to bed; he sat contentedly
on his cot, sopping liniment on a bruised lip, while
fellows kept coming in from other squads, to congratulate.
After a while I went out, and seeing a
little knot of our men at the captain&#8217;s tent, joined
them.
</p>
<p>The officers like to have the men come to them
with questions, and after repeated invitations issued
at general conferences, the men have come
to believe it. So there is growing up a little habit
of stopping at the captain&#8217;s tent for a question
which often extends into an interchange of ideas
from which each side benefits. But they weren&#8217;t
on any technical subject tonight; the men had
got the captain talking on the topic of an officer&#8217;s
life, and they had just reached the items of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
expenses. I had never particularly thought of
this side of the matter before; I knew that an
officer is technically a gentleman and must dress
as such, but that his pay is so small, his perquisites
so few, and his necessary uniforms so
many, I had not realized. To tell the truth, the
little group of us who listened were really rather
shocked that these men who work so hard for
the nation are under such burdens. The captain
perceived it, and for his own interest suddenly
turned the tables on us.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been rather frank, gentlemen,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Now I know your expenses are such as you
choose to make them; but would you mind telling
me how your incomes compare with mine?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The question was perfectly fair, for the men
had been pumping him; and they responded at
once. &#8220;I count on eight thousand yearly from
my factory,&#8221; said one. The next said that his
salary was six. The third, with a little embarrassed
laugh, admitted that he earned ten thousand.
And the next said that last year he cleaned
up forty thousand dollars. As you can imagine,
these were all men older than the average rookie.
They wear their uniforms badly, some of them,
being no longer lithe and lissome; and yet the
forty thousand dollar man was lean and hard
as an Indian. I had so far known him only as a
sportsman who loved to talk about big game.
The captain, as he listened, nodded gravely at
each statement, and when the last had spoken
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
turned his eye on me. I could only tell him the
truth&mdash;twelve thousand as my salary, and perhaps
an equal amount on the side.
</p>
<p>He drew a long breath. &#8220;Well, gentlemen, you
have my congratulations. On the other hand, I&#8217;m
not sorry to have told you these facts about army
life. It&#8217;s well that you civilians should understand
conditions. As for myself, I went into the service
with my eyes open, and I&#8217;m not yet ready
to change it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His eye rather lingered on me. I have the impression
that he&#8217;s acutely conscious of my presence
whenever I&#8217;m about. Is that Vera&#8217;s doing?
Do you suppose she&#8217;s got him too?
</p>
<p>Love from

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Frances</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>I wish I hadn&#8217;t come. Two of them are in
earnest! Lieutenant Pendleton is here every day,
very gay but very desperate. I use the Colonel
all I can against him, and the innocent old
man will talk shop with him by the hour. But
sometimes the lieutenant manages to get me
alone, and only my best cold-storage manner has
saved me so far.
</p>
<p>But if the lieutenant is the kind that takes
you by storm, Captain Kirby is one that will
lay siege. He doesn&#8217;t come so often as the other,
he doesn&#8217;t stay so long, he doesn&#8217;t say so much;
but he is the kind that sticks. I may be able to
stave off the lieutenant, but I shall have to have
it out with the captain.
</p>
<p>I wish you were here. You would be such a
help! Can&#8217;t you manage it? Oh, Frances dear,
I don&#8217;t like army life. Why couldn&#8217;t I be satisfied

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>It rained in the night, and between showers I
went out and fixed the cap of the tent, loosening
also the cords. If we don&#8217;t attend to these latter
as soon as rain begins they are likely to shrink and
tear the canvas, or perhaps pull up the tent pegs.
And if everything holds till morning, then the job
of loosening the ropes, even with three men to
each, is considerable. But I was in time. In the
morning it was cloudy, but we had dry weather
for our baths and breakfast, and for making up
our packs. Then the rain began to patter, and we
to groan. The bugle blew, and we stood expectant
at the doors of our tents, waiting for the
whistle. We awaited the order, &#8220;full equipment,
ponchos over all,&#8221; but the call came, &#8220;non-commissioned
officers, with their drill regulations, at
the head of the street.&#8221; The corporals and sergeants
went, the privates in the tents cheered
madly, and now we are awaiting what may happen
next.
</p>
<p>So in the interval, just a few words about our
proficiency, and our partial failure so far. We
haven&#8217;t done very well, and that&#8217;s a fact. We
march badly, losing distance, interval, and alignment;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
we dress slowly, we fall in with much delay,
and our various manoeuvres are done with much
hesitation and uncertainty. For all this the captain
has, as the boys say, plentifully &#8220;bawled us
out,&#8221; constantly working us more than any other
officer has done in the battalion. We can&#8217;t deny
that we are ragged and slovenly, but why is it?
</p>
<p>To begin with we are trying to do, as the captain
acknowledges, more than could be hoped of
ordinary recruits, we being (ahem!) of the intelligent
class. But intellectually we are uneven,
some of us plainly not being born to be soldiers,
so that with the best of will they lag. Again, the
Plattsburg movement has reached the stage in
which the men have not all come with the same
impulse to serve the country, a considerable proportion
being, as it were, substitutes, being sent
by the public spirit of employers who cannot
come themselves. The motive is excellent, and
they choose, I make no doubt, the best men available
among their clerks. But not all of these are
suitable material, some being here for a lark, and
some being too young to be serious. Such fellows
impede the progress of the others. When the
movement takes still wider scope, or when we
reach the stage of compulsory general training,
evidently the leaven that pretty successfully
leavens this lump will then, being much diluted,
have harder work to do, and to make the mob
into a regiment will take double the time.
Finally, I have already spoken of another of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
our weaknesses, the inexperience of our non-coms.
Most of our corporals are here for the
first time; many of the sergeants, though familiar
with the corporal&#8217;s job, are new at the higher
work. Indeed some of them have never worn
stripes before. They are therefore so necessarily
intent on guarding against their own mistakes
(which still are plentiful) that they can&#8217;t give
enough attention to the blunders of the men.
Nor, as I have said, do I think that the professional
non-com will help us here, unless specially
chosen for understanding the Plattsburger. The
martinet drill-sergeant whose severities the docile
German may bear, would never be tolerated among
us. What we need is to make it a matter of pride
for the veterans of one camp to come back and
serve as corporals in the next and as sergeants in
the next. With regular non-coms in the way
there is no chance for the civilian to make himself
a valuable reserve man; but if he can be tempted
by promotion to come again and yet again, he is
not only now serving the training cause better
than anyone else can, but he is building up a body
of responsible men whom the country can call
upon at need.
</p>
<p>Theories, my dear mother, theories. I will test
them on the hike.
</p>
<p>&mdash;It is the end of a day which I shall look back
upon with respect. Curious that when at breakfast
someone asked me if I found the work strenuous,
I answered that so far I had not found it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
strenuous at all. Since when we have had our
heaviest day&#8217;s work.
</p>
<p>The weather was showery and chilly, and the
non-coms returned from their conference with
orders for us to wear sweaters and ponchos.
Being put into close battalion formation, we were
informed by the major that an enemy had landed
at Keesville, some twenty-odd miles south, and
that we were to march out and get in touch with
him. So our three companies followed the first
battalion along the road to AuSable, having out
the proper patrols&mdash;point and communicating files
and rear guard, with combat patrols&mdash;and we
found ourselves on a real hike.
</p>
<p>It was tramp, tramp, tramp on the hard macadam
all the way. Now remember that though
we have been on hard roads some part of every
day, we have mostly been on gravel or the
turf of the fields and the parade ground. So
we weren&#8217;t really toughened to the work. The
weather bothered us also. The ponchos came off
after a while, then we got heated in the sun, and
were feeling the weight of our sweaters when the
clouds closed in and a shower came. Thus it
changed most of the time. Every forty-five to
fifty minutes we stopped to rest, spread our
ponchos, and lay down. To be exact, after the
first forty-five minutes we rested fifteen, and after
each succeeding fifty we rested ten. We marched
nearly four miles, then turned back. Our company
was now second in the column, but none of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
the patrol duty fell to me, for which I was rather
glad, as a heel began to bother me.
</p>
<p>A man from Squad Seven fell out from the column.
&#8220;This finishes the camp for me,&#8221; he said
ruefully as he left us. He has rigid arches, and it
seems that the doctors have warned him that he
could not stand the marching. He sat and waited
for some kind motorist, and after an hour passed
us, comfortable in a limousine. There were others
among us who got pretty weary; but on the other
hand there were plenty, I am glad to say, who were
not tired, and whistled and sang most of the way,
to the advantage of those who felt weary. Some
of these blades spying a couple of bold damsels,
cried &#8220;Eyes Right!&#8221; at which they giggled. But
the captain made us march at attention, and explained,
when we got back to camp, that we were
expected to mind our manners in the presence of
the other sex (or as he put it, persons in female
attire) else we might be sure of marching at attention
for the whole of the way.
</p>
<p>We were back at the usual time, after seven
miles and a half, and I, wet from inside and from
out, was glad to wash and change and find leisure
to inspect my troublesome heel, on which I
found two blisters which Clay, being as I told
you a medico, skilfully doctored.
</p>
<p>But there was no rest for the weary. I foolishly
rejoiced when I escaped the work of helping
to make up the shooting records, also (perhaps
not so foolishly) when the typhoid sufferers were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
taken to be inoculated for the third time. But
while the captain supervised the company clerks,
the lieutenant, in anticipation of a regimental
parade, took us out on the field. See how carefully
it was done. As we were but the fraction of
a company he lined us up and made up squads
afresh, a corporal to each, then instructed us in
our parade work, and drilled us for two hours.
Having my two blisters, I did not enjoy it, and
the men were groaning all around me. He was
as hard to please as the captain; once, looking
back along the line as we marched company front,
he said, &#8220;The ancestors of this bunch certainly
must have been a lot of snakes!&#8221; But I&#8217;ll venture
to say that none of us, after this, will forget
how to oblique in making the turn.
</p>
<p>After ten minutes&#8217; rest, we were taken to calisthenics,
after which I anticipated a good loaf.
But no, we were assembled, the whole regiment,
for a conference concerning our return home by
government aid, the major and a railroad agent
instructing us in the terms. I was glad to find
that I can simply go home on my return ticket,
and let the treasury department pay me when
it&#8217;s good and ready; and after standing in line
for half an hour I was able to state my intention
to do this.
</p>
<p>There was then just time to change for the
parade, which was partly interesting, partly tedious.
Thanks to the lieutenant&#8217;s drill, we made
no mistakes, though at one time we had to make
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
our way at company front among the boxes
and barrels strewed in the neighborhood of the
quartermaster&#8217;s shack. Lieutenant Pendleton
briefly said, when we were back in the street,
&#8220;You did well.&#8221; And the captain, who left the
scoring long enough to watch the parade, joked
us on being mountain goats.
</p>
<p>The blisters are no worse for the afternoon&#8217;s
work. It is raining steadily. Love from

<p style='text-align: right; '><i>Plattsburg, Saturday the 23d.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>We are having really rainy weather. Till now
it has rained but a few hours at most, with intervals
for drying. But it rained steadily all last
evening, drummed on the tight tent all night, and
was still heavily at work when the bugler failed
to blow his horn this morning. Watches not
being at all uniform, men got themselves out of
bed at their leisure. The first sergeant did not
think to wake us, and then was disgusted when
many of the men did not turn out at the first call.
Those who were there made a crooked line around
a great puddle which stood in the depression between
our ridge and the head of the street.
</p>
<p>But now, after breakfast, everyone is cussing.
&#8220;What are we to wear?&#8221; asked Knudsen of the
first sergeant, who answered snappily, &#8220;The usual
things for a hike.&#8221; Knudsen came back grumbling:
&#8220;How were we to know that we are going on
a hike?&#8221; The word was passed along: &#8220;Packs,&#8221;
&#8220;No packs.&#8221; &#8220;Sweaters,&#8221; &#8220;No sweaters.&#8221; Then
it was said that we were to wear handkerchiefs in
our hats, sure sign of a sham battle pending. So
at last at the whistle we turned out with sweaters,
packs, ponchos ready (for though it had stopped
raining we did not feel safe) and some of us with
handkerchiefs twined in our hat-bands. Once in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
line we were sent back&mdash;&#8220;No packs, no rifles.&#8221;
Again we came out and lined up again, only to be
sent back once more. &#8220;No sweaters.&#8221; By this
time it was rumored that we were at last to take
the oath, and this was confirmed by the sight of
the captain carrying a bunch of slips, containing
the oath, which in the last few days we have filled
out, and yesterday had signed. The men both
grumbled and joked. &#8220;We can&#8217;t take the oath
with sweaters on? Why not?&#8221; &#8220;Got on woollen
underwear? Get cotton. You can&#8217;t take the
oath in wool.&#8221; So at last we were in line again,
and then the captain began to look through the
slips. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a man written his name twice
differently. Make out a new slip.&mdash;Here&#8217;s a lot
of men have signed with lead pencil. It&#8217;s got to
be in ink or indelible pencil.&#8221; Here he was met
by a lawyer, who had signed in pencil, and said,
&#8220;A pencil signature is valid.&#8221; &#8220;Not here,&#8221; said
the captain, sticking to the regulations, and the
slips had to be changed.
</p>
<p>When we were ready we were marched to the
flag, where the company was drawn up on three
sides of a square. The major then said&mdash;
</p>
<p>&mdash;I must break this off to describe what is
going on, which is too interesting to ignore. For
the second time this afternoon we are shut up in
the dark tent, everyone having fled before a pelting
shower. We were first aligned for calisthenics,
but were dismissed on account of Shower No. 1,
a driving rain that lasted half an hour. Now we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
were just ready for parade&mdash;think what it would
have been on that slimy, soggy ground!&mdash;when the
approach of Shower No. 2 sent us all to cover.
It is pelting furiously; Pickle and Knudsen, with
the intrenching tools which luckily were served
out to us this afternoon, are digging frantically
to keep the water away from their suit-cases.
Through the tied flaps of the doorway Clay has
been yelling at Squad Nine, our opposite neighbors,
and there is the greatest joy and confusion.
Knudsen having finished his job, is jeering at
Pickle, who had promised to be first. And now
he has taken Pickle in hand, and is showing him
his mistakes. It is thundering and lightening. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see,&#8221; says David with slow wonderment,
&#8220;how it can rain much harder.&#8221; Now Knudsen,
at the door, imitates the first sergeant&#8217;s whistle
and alarms our neighbors, who peer anxiously out.
&#8220;Corporals, get your men out!&#8221; cries he, laughing
heartily as the others consult. &#8220;They look like a
bunch of dogs,&#8221; says he, &#8220;with their heads sticking
out of their kennels.&#8221; Now it slackens, I hear
laughter in the street, and in comes a neighbor.
&#8220;Boys, it&#8217;s a scream! There&#8217;s four inches of
water in the next two tents. Their baggage is all
afloat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>(Later.) The rain slackening just then, out we
all swarmed, the whole street becoming alive with
men, who with shouts crowded toward the great
puddle which completely filled the breadth of the
street, and had flooded tents Four and Six. Looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
into these, I saw the glimmer of lantern-light
reflected on water, the beds moved about and
piled with baggage. The sandy soil can drain an
ordinary shower, but this was too heavy, and there
was but one thing to try. Yelling, some fifteen
men got out their intrenching tools and began to
dig a ditch to lead the water off to the field below.
At first I thought they could not do it, for the
ridge was at least two feet above the level of the
puddle. But leaving enough earth to form a dam,
the men in a line so vigorously worked the strong
little shovels that in scarcely more than five
minutes they were ready to break down the dam.
They broke it, the water came pouring through,
and with cheers the men kept the channel clear.
With great brooms the men of tents Four and Six
swept out their domiciles, other men dug the
channel deeper, still others on the further slope
kept the flood from the other tents, and as we
formed for supper (the two parts of the company
on the two sides of the dividing puddle) the lake
was more than half drained away. By the time
we came back from mess the puddle was clean
gone, and the captain was devising means to get
the men of tents Four and Six in dry quarters for
the night.
</p>
<p>And now to take up my narrative, earlier
broken off.&mdash;The major, as we were assembled
for the oath, said a few words in explanation of
it, then read it aloud, while we stood with hats off
and right hands raised, before the flag. At the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
end each man said &#8220;I do!&#8221; and then one by one
we acknowledged our signatures on our slips. So
I am now enlisted in the army of the United States,
bound to obey the President and the Secretary of
War, and entirely at the mercy of our superior
officers.
</p>
<p>But they have been merciful to us today in
sparing us two soakings, and I have had my own
personal share. While we were standing, waiting
for the major to come and give us the oath, the
captain&#8217;s eye fell on me. Evidently he pondered
for a moment, then he beckoned me out of the
ranks. Said he, &#8220;I thought you weren&#8217;t to take
the oath.&#8221; I answered, &#8220;I have always meant
to take it, sir.&#8221; &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said he, &#8220;then I was misinformed.
Well, that is what prevented me from
making you sub-squad-leader, and I&#8217;ll do it today.
Just say nothing about it beforehand.&#8221;
So I saluted and stepped back. When we were
lined up in the company street again (having first
put our sweaters on by our own decision, and then
having taken them off by order of the major, who
presently took us to regimental drill on the parade
ground) the lieutenant announced, &#8220;Mr. Godwin
will be sub-squad-leader in Squad Eight.&#8221;
So I dropped back into the rear rank, my rear-rank
man took my place, Reardon gave place to
me, and the other men moved to numbers two
and one. In that order we drilled, and good Reardon
showed me his duties. To make sure that
the change is permanent, Bannister asked the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
captain, and here I am installed in a very minor
office.
</p>
<p>I am out of the front rank now, but the parades,
which it is interesting to watch, are all over, and
I shall get acquainted with still another set of our
neighbors. On the hike I shall still march on the
outside of the column, which gives some freedom
of action, and as Knudsen contends, better air.
Reardon is very nice about the change; the boys
all recognize it as coming from my bluff at giving
orders. Yet Reardon showed, as I drill beside
him today, that he knows more of the business
than I do.
</p>
<p>Bannister shook his fist at me. &#8220;Consarn ye,&#8221;
(he imitates the farmer to perfection) &#8220;yer
shan&#8217;t git my job!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming strong!&#8221; I answered.
</p>
<p>Knudsen, with the energy and tact which characterize
him, has reorganized the squad on the
basis of this change of mine, moving the men
about so that he has David as his rear rank man,
which means that they sleep in the same tent on
the hike, and that Knudsen still has the boy in
charge. Of course Bannister agreed to it all. He
and I shall tent together.
</p>
<p>Corder feels that he has had a narrow escape.
The captain sent for him and offered him the
position of equipment sergeant, or some such
title, which means some minor responsibility and
a seat on one of the baggage trucks. Corder,
in a panic, begged permission to stay with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
squad and carry his gun; and the captain, saying
how disgusted the bugler was with his new job,
and that two disappointed men in the company
were more than he could stand, let him off. Corder,
after telling us the tale, got out his mirror
and studied himself. &#8220;It&#8217;s all this confounded
beard of mine,&#8221; he complained. &#8220;I&#8217;m only forty-five,
and my hair is still black, but the thing has
turned gray and makes me seem old. It&#8217;s sickening
to have the fellows so thoughtful of me.
Godwin, if ever you get respectful, I&#8217;ll slay you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The shooting records are posted, and to our
great satisfaction our company stands best.
That doesn&#8217;t mean that we have the highest individual
score, or even the greatest number of
expert riflemen. But it does mean that we have
both the most men in all three qualified grades
and the highest average score per man. Practically
that means that of all the six companies
we should be deadliest against an infantry attack,
also that as a consequence we should ourselves
be safest. As Pickle says, &#8220;The captain has done
one good job.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The forehanded among us (and yet after all we
are at it pretty late) are making maps for the hike
in imitation of those which the officers have posted
for us to study. At the Exchange can be bought
contour maps of all this region, covering the whole
area of the hike. These we are cutting out in
squares and pasting on linen, cheese-cloth, or
even mosquito netting. Then we mark on them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
the camps, the route, and all along the way the
important crossroads within a mile of our march,
which we number according to the officers&#8217; sample.
If after this we can get some shellac, we coat the
map against the weather. Had I only known
enough, I should have brought with me proper
cloth, glue and shellac for this purpose; for of
course the rush for these materials has practically
used up all neighboring supplies.
</p>
<p>Between showers today we have begun our
preparations for the hike, directions concerning
which were read us. We have turned in our condiment-cans
and bacon-tins&mdash;so much less weight
to carry. David is in secret dismay over the small
equipment which is allowed us, and has spent
many long minutes over the beautiful little sole
leather trunk which he keeps under his cot, and
which contains so many knickknacks. He has
been making little piles here, and little piles there,
and then, with knitted brow, changing them all
about. He has not asked for advice, and none
of us has offered it. Pickle, whose personal outfit
is of the most meagre, has been watching him
in delight.
</p>
<p>However, David is permanently lightened of
one part of his equipment. Word went round
that we were to have rifle-inspection, at which
there rose in the tent a great clamor for patches,
of which we had none, nor the store tent either.
David was absent, and Knudsen, saying &#8220;I&#8217;ll get
patches,&#8221; asked Clay for his surgical scissors,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
and going to David&#8217;s cot, took from the great
collection of conveniences which the boy still
hoped to take with him, a set of his beautiful silk
pajamas. The jacket Knudsen tore into strips
(we all the while watching in pregnant silence)
then cut them into squares, and when David returned
we were all at work on our guns.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They tell me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that we&#8217;re to have
rifle inspection. Have you fellows any patches?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty,&#8221; said Knudsen, and handed him some
made out of the gaudiest part of the pattern.
</p>
<p>David, as he inspected these, first grew very
red, then hastily demanded, &#8220;Who cut these
up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; said Knudsen very serenely. &#8220;No
pajamas on the hike, David.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And the boy, who is still very proud of coming
into his own name, laughed, asked for Clay&#8217;s
scissors, and cut up the rest of his suit. Then he
stuffed into his trunk the other pair which he had
intended to take with him on the hike.
</p>
<p>One last story, to show a different side of our
Plattsburg activities. You know we have a
cavalry camp here, and a medical department,
where volunteers come exactly as to our infantry
regiment. Well, Corder came back from the
medicos lately, where he went to visit a friend,
with a great tale of the mending of a cavalryman&#8217;s
broken jaw by one of the volunteer surgeons, a
Boston dentist. Corder, being professor-like in
appearance, was not detected as an impostor, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
stood close at hand in the ring of doctors who
watched the clinic.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was done under field conditions,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;the operator using only an alcohol lamp, a small
pair of nippers, and about eight inches of ordinary
electric light wire, which happened to be handy.
The insulation was scraped from the cable, and
its various fine wires were burned clean in the
flame of the lamp. The rookie was then put on a
table in the company street, and the doctor took
a turn with one of the fine wires around a tooth
behind the break, twisting the ends together.
The same was done with a tooth in front of the
break; and then in the upper jaw wires were
twisted around teeth above the lower two. An
assistant then held the broken jaw in place, and
the doctor twisted tight together the wires from
the lower back tooth and the upper front tooth,
and then those from the upper back tooth and
the lower front tooth. He cut off the ends, made
all smooth, and the work was done, all in a very
few minutes. The jaw could not move, and was
bound to heal perfectly. The doctors all said
they never had seen anything so simple or so
clever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>We thought the same; Clay, as a budding doctor,
was envious of Corder for having seen it.
&#8220;Too bad for the chap to lose the hike,&#8221; said
Bannister.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t lose it!&#8221; replied Corder. &#8220;The
fellow can drink, of course. He can get any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
liquid, or even a cereal or a stew, around behind
his back teeth, so he&#8217;s simply going right along
with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So much for smartness, and for grit!
</p>
<p>The showers lasting long enough to spoil conferences,
and then the sky clearing, I went this
evening to say good-by to Vera, which I had
half promised to do. David, by the way, to whom
a social duty used to be sacred, called yesterday
afternoon, as Knudsen suggested, and was manfully
relieved to find her out. But I found her
in, and alone. She told me that her sister Frances
was coming, made rather a point of it, expecting
me to manage to see her, though on the hike how
can I? There was a delightful old colonel there,
who rather took to me, and when on the coming
of Lieutenant Pendleton I naturally tried to make
myself scarce, the colonel took me into his study
to show me the service pistol that they used in
his day. And when finally I took my leave of
him, on my way out (missing the front door and
blundering into the parlor) I ran into the most
distressing sort of scene.
</p>
<p>Pendleton and Kirby were both there, and the
captain having his hat in his hand, I imagine he&#8217;d
only just come. The lieutenant was fiery red; I
think I know the look of a man when he&#8217;s been
turned down, and I saw it in his face. Vera was
in that cold and lofty mood of hers when nothing
counts but the idea she has in mind; no one seeing
her so would think she ever again could be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
gentle or tender&mdash;poor Vera, with all her struggles
to perfect herself, and yet with so much
manner, yes and so much headstrong will, hiding
it all. It seemed as if she had called the captain
to witness, perhaps to agree in, something she had
just announced; you know it, mother, that old
idea of hers that caused me such years of effort.
I heard the words just as I parted the curtains,
and they stopped me dead.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A man should be able to offer a woman the
best that there is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Pendleton with his head hanging low, Kirby
gone white under his tan and looking as if he had
been shot through the heart&mdash;but that was not
all. Vera herself looked sick and&mdash;there is no
other word than desperate. Explain it if you can.
All I could do was to find my way out as quickly
and silently as I could.
</p>
<p>I went across the parade-ground and walked
up and down by the lake, to still my many memories.
Poor Vera! She is still groping, having a
woman&#8217;s instincts but yet suppressing them. If
only the right man could show her her true self,
she is so honest she would recognize it. But
where is he? or how could he get to know the
heart which she herself does not understand?
</p>
<p>On the way back to camp I went through the
woods, and there I passed the poor lieutenant,
walking with dragging step, still with his head
upon his breast. But when I came to the company
street, there in front of his tent stood the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
captain, a different picture. He was as straight
as a&mdash;well, as a soldier, which he was, every inch
of him, with his head up and his jaw set. I saluted,
and he returned the salute, always with
that searching look at me which now I&#8217;m sure of
the meaning of. Yes, Vera&#8217;s got him too.
</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time, for every reason, that we were away
from here.

<p>Everything has gone wrong, quite wrong. I
thought I could keep the lieutenant off, but I
did not realize what a soldier is. Last night he
had to have his answer, and I was telling him as
gently as I could, when the stupid servant opened
the front door to the captain and let him make
his own way into the parlor, where he stood before
I had heard a sound. If he didn&#8217;t see what was
going on, he was blind.
</p>
<p>And then I lost my head over the sudden notion
that here was my chance to get rid of him
too. For the man frightens me, Frances; I never
met one who was so steady and so determined
and so strong. Maybe I blundered; I don&#8217;t know.
But I can&#8217;t have him getting to know me any
better; I want never to see him again. So I said
(I know I stiffened horribly as I said it, the thing
was so uncalled for and so un-nice) &#8220;The lieutenant
and I were just discussing army life, captain,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
and how little it has for a woman. For a
man ought to be able to offer the best that there
is.&#8221; It hurt him; it hurt his opinion of me. He
went away almost without a word. I never was
so ashamed; never before have I felt like a
butcher. But if I meant it why shouldn&#8217;t I say
it? Let him hate me, if only he lets me alone.
</p>
<p>They march out Monday, and as I hear the
drums go by on the main road I shall be glad.
But I do so want to see you. Hurry the Chapmans
all you can.
</p>
<p>Longingly,

</p>
<p>I am writing just a few lines to say that we
are off tomorrow on the hike, in light marching
order, and with very little bagage. I shall not
even take my pajjamas. But I&#8217;d rather you
wouldn&#8217;t tell mother this; it would upset her.
Will you tell her that I&#8217;m really too busy to
write, but that I&#8217;m in very fine condition, and
she&#8217;s not to worry about me? And she said in her
last letter something about taking a trip up here
so as to be near us on the hike if anything should
happen to me. This is really what I&#8217;m writing
you about. Please stop her, father. I&#8217;d really
rather she wouldn&#8217;t even be here when we break
camp to take me home in the car. For I&#8217;d like
to go home with the Boston bunch in the train.
</p>
<p>I think in my earlier letters I wasn&#8217;t fair to
some of the fellows in our squad. Perhaps I
didn&#8217;t know how to get at them at first. Even
now I don&#8217;t suppose mother would see anything
in them; yet I&#8217;m sure that if I could introduce
you to them you&#8217;d understand why I like them.
</p>
<p>Just keep mother from worrying about me on
the hike. I shall be all right. Affectionatly,

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>This morning it has turned chilly, without sun,
and with clouds threatening more rain. As before,
I did some washing before breakfast, and
now have on the line considerable of my laundry,
which I am anxiously feeling of from time to
time. If it does not dry, then I shall have to buy
some new things for tomorrow.
</p>
<p>There being no duties today, men are neglecting
church and getting ready for the hike. We
must turn in our mattress covers, pillow slips,
barrack bags, and for those who do not wish to
buy, the overcoats. The captain has sent out
word that overcoats may be bought, and I have
secured mine by the payment of $9.96; for those
who have not the change, the price is $10. Down
the street from the store-tent extends a line of
men with their surplus in their arms, while I take
advantage of their necessarily slow progress to
write this to you. One of my pillow-slips I shall
retain by the sacrifice of seven cents; it shall
serve as a bag to keep my extra things together
on the march.
</p>
<p>Men are making sure of their homeward accommodations.
When I went to the D. &amp; H.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
tent it was so full of waiting men that I came
away, and must go again. So much for neglecting
a duty till the last.
</p>
<p>Word has just gone down the street that we
must pack this morning for the hike, and give
our bags in at the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. for storage. So
we shall be on a hike basis from now on, and tonight
I shall sleep in my clothes, with my blankets
and poncho made up into a sleeping bag.
It is wonderful what the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. does for
us, giving to all who come every kind of information,
cashing our checks, supplying pen and ink
and paper to the epistolary, and giving minor
helps constantly. It is to them a very burdensome
expense, which they have no fund to meet.
I shall leave something behind to show my appreciation.
</p>
<p>For the coming ten days I have gone into
woollens for the first time in years, on account of
the expected contact with mother earth. I shall
carry three pair of stockings, a change of underwear,
an extra shirt and extra trousers and shoes,
and a light sweater to supplement my service
one, with several small conveniences. We shall
live rough and rather dirty, and the hike will
finish much of the outfit.
</p>
<p>&mdash;It is evening, and I am all ready. The day
has been given to sorting and packing, storing
my suit-case, getting my berth home, and again
sorting, and again packing. For when we tried
to stuff into the squad-bag the eight bundles that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
we made of our extra belongings, it happened as
we might have expected, and we had to discard
half of our dunnage. Here is my final equipment.
</p>
<p>In my belt, thirty blank cartridges, and in the
extra pockets my flashlight, some surgeon&#8217;s plaster,
and some of David&#8217;s silk patches.
</p>
<p>In my pocket the foot-powder which it is my
duty to carry as sub-squad-leader. (The other
men carry the intrenching tools and the wire-cutter.
The corporal carries nothing but the
weight of his responsibilities.)
</p>
<p>In my pack the usual shelter-half, poncho,
blanket, tent-pins, rope, meat-can, knife and fork
and spoon, with bayonet. In addition I stuff in
an o. d. shirt (it dried today!) a towel, soap,
tooth-brush, shaving things etc., a pair of socks,
and my map.
</p>
<p>In the pillow-case in the squad-bag, shoes,
trousers, change of underwear and socks, towel,
writing materials, sewing things.
</p>
<p>In the squad-roll the blankets and sweaters.
</p>
<p>Cool weather is certain, and having heard that
the captain may send back for our coats, we who
have bought ours have deposited them at the
store-tent for this purpose.
</p>
<p>My map I have at last finished with much
clumsy care; dozens of us have spent hours today
at the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A., absorbed in this work, which
with the accurate inking of the route and crossroads,
has been rather minute. The numbering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
of many crossroads is very significant of the
skirmishes that await us.
</p>
<p>The mail follows us; the address is unchanged.
</p>
<p>Tonight the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. is full of men sending
last letters home. Several have dropped out of
the company, on account of feet or knees or digestion,
or else from natural business reasons.
The company is sad to learn that we start without
Loretta, business calling him home for a few days.
But we shall be glad to see him when he comes.
</p>
<p>Today I ventured something, the results of
which, if there are any, I suppose I shall never
know. Our two officers have been very much,
on my mind. Pendleton has been his usual self
emphasized, very much on his job of receiving
the equipment, extra clear and precise, more subtle
and more distant in his little ironical smile.
The captain, also busy with the equipment work,
was surprisingly gentle, patient with all our many
blunders, very quiet spoken, and somehow closer
to us. But while he attended to us so carefully,
somehow I felt that he was thinking of something
else.
</p>
<p>Now last night Pendleton, I thank God, could
not have seen me at the portieres, nor could Vera.
But the captain might have, for he faced my way;
surely he must have seen the curtains open. If
he recognized me, I know he must have thought
of it today when, the last of the men gone, and
his tallies all made up, he stood up from the table
that had been placed in front of his tent, just
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
as I came along by. We were entirely apart
from the rest; so I, having thought a good deal
on how far I could venture, took my chance to
speak.
</p>
<p>I had to be quick, or he would have stopped
me. Said I: &#8220;Miss Wadsworth doesn&#8217;t live down
to her theories, captain. Certainly she didn&#8217;t
do it in my case.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then, saluting, I was off. By the gleam that
had sprung to his eyes I knew that he understood
me, even though he said nothing. For of course
he has been wondering whether after all I have
a chance with Vera, and has been weighing his
earnings against mine.
</p>
<p>Dreary business, this love making. Lucky
I&#8217;m out of it.

</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Frances</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>In spite of my trying to stop it, it has happened.
</p>
<p>He came walking in yesterday evening, when I
was all by myself in the parlor. I have told you,
you remember, that one of his qualities is a strange
gentleness. He told me, in that manner of his,
that he would take only a minute of my time, and
while I sat perfectly tongue-tied before him, as if
I were a schoolgirl, this is what he said, without
any passionate declaration, or any self-assertion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I came last night, Miss Wadsworth, to tell
you that I loved you. You saw it and stopped
me. There seemed no answer to you then, but I
have found one now, and I think you ought to
let me say it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You said that a man ought to be able to
offer to a woman the best that there is. I came
to offer it. Our army women serve their country,
not as we men do, yet they do serve the flag, and
unselfishly. There is really nothing better that
can be done by man or woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is only one other thing that seems to
me worth while. It makes the cottage the equal
of the palace. I brought it&mdash;honest love. No
true woman can ask more.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>Then he went away. I could not stop him;
could not try to explain. How could I say anything
against those awful words? Besides, he
spoke with such a thrill as if he were showing me
his religion. A dreadful simplicity of belief! I
know all his words by heart. All night long I
have been saying them over and over; and when
this morning I heard the drums, it was as if they
said them too.

<p style='text-align: right; '>Monday the 25th, 3 P. M.</p>
</div>

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>How glad I was, at the end of today&#8217;s hike, to
march into the big field (where the cook tents
already stood with smoking fires before them)
to have the two halves of the company line up
facing each other, and to hear the captain command,
&#8220;Form for shelter tents!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The file-closers scurried round and got into the
vacant places. Every man gave an anticipatory
hitch at the pack that had gradually grown so
heavy; and the front rank men, if they thought
the captain was not looking, loosened their
bayonets in their sheaths.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take interval, to the right and left!&#8221; We
rear rank men stepped four paces backward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Harch!&#8221; Both ranks faced away from the
cook tents, and the lieutenant began to count,
&#8220;<i>One</i>&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;<i>One</i>&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four!&#8221;
and at every <i>One</i> a pair of men, front
and rear rank bunkies, stepped off together, till
the whole company was marching by pairs, at
intervals of four paces, and the captain thundered
orders to the guides to march straight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Halt!&#8221; And halting, we faced inward to
what was to be the company street. I unclasped
my belt.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pitch shelter tents!&#8221; Out came the bayonets
of the front rank men, and were thrust into the
ground at the right heel. Then down with the
rifles, off with the packs, and we on our knees
were hastily opening them and dragging out the
shelter-halves, the pins, and the ropes. Bann
and I laid the long sides of our halves together,
lapping the upper one away from the wind, and
buttoned them along (how glad I was that we
practised this yesterday, found where a loop was
missing and some button-holes torn, and made
everything good!) The ropes were tied in the
loops, Bann&#8217;s rifle was stood beside his bayonet,
the muzzle beneath the front loop; we aligned our
sloping ridgepole at right angles to the street,
drove in our front and rear pins and tied the ropes,
and then I, creeping into the tent with my bayonet
in its sheath, set it upright under the end of
the ridge. Then quickly we pegged down the
sides and back, stretching them well out, laid back
the front flaps of our kennel, set our equipment
in the double doorway, passed the inspection of
the lieutenant, and felt proud. Then mess, with
its stew and its vegetables, its bread and butter,
and even with milk, which we are warned we may
never see again. Since when we have been retrospecting,
doctoring, washing at a poor apology
for a brook, and making ourselves comfortable
in anticipation of Retreat and of the night.
</p>
<p>Remarkable things, these shelter tents, just
broad enough at the front for the shoulders of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
two men, and at the back for their feet, with
a further recess for the equipment. Along the
edges can be stowed the toilet articles and such
things as need to be handy, with the spare rifle.
After removing all boulders from the floor, and
digging hollows for our hips, we have carpeted
with straw, bought of a thrifty farmer who hauled
it here and sold for twenty-five cents per poncho- or
blanket-load. We now know a little better the
meaning of the term buzzard. On the thick
layer we have made our beds, some of the fellows&#8217;
together, but Bann&#8217;s and mine separately, for I
have warned him that I am a restless sleeper.
On my tummy on my sleeping bag I am writing
to you now.
</p>
<p>We have already discovered that since we must
have our rifles for Retreat it is wise to have poles
for our tents, and so they have mysteriously
appeared from the neighboring woods. They will
travel in the blanket rolls from camp to camp.
Should I come again to Plattsburg I shall get a
broom-stick for the hike, provided with conveniences
for hanging socks, tooth-brush, and
candle-socket. Fellows are tying candles to their
poles with string, convenient enough till the string
burns and the candle tumbles down into the straw.
</p>
<p>I can imagine difficulty in pitching tents under
other circumstances than are provided by this
ideal afternoon. In the rain we shan&#8217;t care to
have the tents face the wind, nor shall we enjoy
setting up tents in a gale, when we shall also hope
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
for better holding ground for the short tent-pins
than we find here in this gravel. As it is, we have
piled stones on the pins today. Some fellows
have ditched their tents, but Bann and I don&#8217;t
see the need of that except with more of a threat
of rain than is given by this cloudless sky.
</p>
<p>Now if you can imagine in a field, sloping
gently to the west, some four hundred and fifty
or more of these pup-tents, with a thousand men
or less swarming around and in them, some coming
back from a bath in the brook, some cleaning
guns, some making fireplaces for an evening fire,
some napping, some writing; if you can hear
much talk and laughter, the chopping of axes
at the cook tents, the call &#8220;Corporals, come and
get your mail for your squads!&#8221; then you can
understand what a lively, busy place this is.
Just across the fence is a camp of cavalry; there
is a squadron in our field also. Running across
the heads of the streets are the big cook tents;
close by are the tents of the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. and the
Exchange and the photographer; elsewhere are
the officer&#8217;s big conical tents, each with the
luxury of a stove; and in still another spot is the
doctor&#8217;s tent, not far from the shelter-tents of
the band. Men are idling everywhere, and working
everywhere also. The long line of trucks is
drawn up not far from the field entrance, and the
drivers are tinkering them for tomorrow.
</p>
<p>But outside the sacred enclosure of the camp,
yet as near as they can squeeze, are the buzzards,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
each with his little outfit for following the hike.
A scrawny horse, a little tent, a board on two
barrels, a big sign&mdash;these with indigestibles constitute
their outfits. In the camp wander men
with baskets, or boys with boxes, selling fruit,
tobacco, and chocolate. There are the farmer
folk, too, gawking about at the show.
</p>
<p>&mdash;And now, sitting on the ground near the bright
lamp of the telegraph table outside the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A.
tent, while a dozen others crouch in the radius of
its rays, I am writing these last words. Night
has fallen. Inside the tent men are almost solidly
crowded together on the floor as they sit to write
letters, while yet men in a steady stream step
over and among them, to get at the table stamps,
pen and ink, and paper.
</p>
<p>The day of course has been crowded pretty
full. This morning at Plattsburg the confusion
in the company street was great. As we had to
make up our blanket rolls before breakfast we
had to put our sweaters in and shiver in our
shirts. Packs were made up, tents were policed,
cots and mattresses handed in, and then we were
off, as the advance guard of an army camped at
the post. But today&#8217;s problem, though explained
by map to us at conference this afternoon, did
not affect H company. Our battalion was only
the support; the first battalion carried on the
necessary skirmish that cleared the road of the
cavalry, our opponents. While they were chasing
them far from the line of march, we plodded safely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
along the macadam, and pitched tents before the
others.
</p>
<p>Concerning the hike, these facts. My feet are
unblistered, though at one rest, being panic-stricken,
I hastily filled stockings and shoes with
foot-powder. At another time I found the pace
telling on me, and was sadly thinking that I was
still too soft, when I heard grumbling all about me.
The step had been quickened, and all were feeling
it. At the grumbling Corder turned to me a face
of relief. &#8220;Thank Heaven!&#8221; he said piously. &#8220;I
thought I was growing old.&#8221; Our route was
through the edge of Plattsburg, along some miles
of highway, and then by gravel roads to this camp
near Ryan&#8217;s Grove, which is a fine sugar bush on
the hillside below us. After only eight miles of
road, there were very few of us that were not glad
to get here.
</p>
<p>Our system of serving food is curious. Each
man has knife, fork, spoon, canteen cup, and meat
can. Falling into line at the bugle call (in no
order, every man for himself) the knife, fork and
spoon are stuck into a legging, and perhaps, until
we reach the serving places, the canteen cup is
also carried there, by the handle. The meat-can
is an oval sauce-pan with a shallow top, over
which shuts down its folding handle. Opening
this, one carries in one hand the can and cover,
in the other the cup, and filing past the cooks,
who stand in line, one receives from each some
part of the ration. Then we retire to the most
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
convenient spot to eat, if we are hungry come for
a second helping, and if we are lucky, get it.
</p>
<p>Of the dish-washing, since I know your passion
for cleanliness and absolute sanitation, I spare
you the details, except this significant one. The
cooks having retired for their own meal, I saw one
fellow wash his meat-can in the abandoned coffee
barrel, mistaking its fine rich contents for the dishwater.
</p>
<p>You should have seen our field at the coming of
the dusk: the dying sunset, the silhouetting of the
upper tents against the sky, the coming out of
the many fires, and in the light of their flames, reflected
in the drifting smoke, the lively picturesqueness
of the camp. This is all accentuated by the
dark. Such coming and going, such talking and
greeting, such stumbling in the shadows and peering
against the fires&mdash;well, I never could have imagined
it.
</p>
<p>I must turn in, though with regret at not being
able to buy myself a knitted cap for the night,
against this sharp cold. The felt hat will suffer
by such use, and besides will serve badly. Love
from

<p><i>Postscript.</i> A rumor is running through the
camp (we are specially warned not to believe
rumors, but this one is borne out by the behavior
of the officers) that someone in the regiment has a

<p>It is early dawn on Tuesday, and I have slept
better, on &#8220;my pallet of straw,&#8221; than many a
time in my bed at home. The cooks have for
some time been stirring, as I have known by the
sound of their axes, the crackling of their fires,
the glow reflected on their tents, and their occasional
voices. In the cavalry camp the horses
stamp, I hear a distant train and a dog&#8217;s bark,
and nearer at hand, from among the pup-tents,
come little morning coughs. My writing is practically
invisible to me on the paper. I can just
see that I trace a line.
</p>
<p>There are thistles in this straw!
</p>
<p>Last night I saw a lost soul. Rousing, as I
often do, at one o&#8217;clock, I stood at the door of
the tent, admiring Orion in the east and the constellations
overhead. I heard a little murmur of
complaint, and saw a man come stumbling down
the street, his bare feet softly thudding on the
stones, and drawing from him this sad sound as
he came shivering along in pajamas. He was
stooping at each tent and peering in to discover
his lost place. So he passed out of my sight,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
but when I once more turned to admire Orion I
saw the same unhappy phantom wandering along
the next company street, still stumbling, still
shivering, still silently searching for his couch.
As for me, I turned in again and slept.
</p>
<p>(Later, and more legible.)
</p>
<p>We have broken camp, all the tents being struck;
and next we have been given a lesson in military
neatness. Each company has had to police its
street, to fill all tent-ditches and fireplaces, and
to pick up each bit of rubbish and scrap of
paper. Our squad having had a meeting upon
the subject, has agreed that immediately upon
making up our packs we shall police our own
ground, either bury the rubbish in the ditches
or burn it in the fire, using if necessary a little
of our hay, and pile the rest of the latter as
quickly as possible, to get the work over with.
This is in response to the captain&#8217;s latest, for
finding a single scrap of paper as big as a postage
stamp in the street, he turned out a whole
squad to pick it up. Next time, he says, it will
be a platoon. We know Kirby too well by this
time to suppose he doesn&#8217;t mean what he says.
</p>
<p>I am writing as I loll on a pile of hay, while my
neighbors are vigorously resenting the demand
of the farmer who sold us the hay last night,
that we rise and relinquish it to him&mdash;in order
that he may sell it again tonight. Much angry
computation as to his profits per ton, and a
warning that, as on account of our ignorance he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
raised the tariff on us yesterday, we should never
again pay more than ten cents per tent.
</p>
<p>(As we stand waiting in rank.)
</p>
<p>Orders for today have been issued. The enemy
cavalry and machine guns are at Sciota, some
miles north of us. We are to go against them,
with our battalion as advance guard, Company
I in the lead, our company supporting them four
hundred yards behind.
</p>
<p>(Resting on the road.)
</p>
<p>We have been marching at hot speed, having
no one to set the pace for Kirby, now that at last
we have passed I company. For a while we had
to wait on them while they drove the enemy, hearing
their firing, and at every halt sending out
patrols. At last we drew near the firing line,
which had been pretty hard at work, but which
drew aside by the roadside (being either dead or
out of ammunition) to let us go by, while we acclaimed
them as having died heroically in our
defense. Then came urgent work on our part,
till now, as we halt, the platoon leader is telling
us that we are to go forward over a wire fence,
deploy behind a stone wall, and wait for the field
battery to shell the enemy.
</p>
<p>&mdash;And now we have crawled through the wire,
and are comfortably watching the lieutenant of
artillery while, with his instruments all fixed, he
is getting the range of the enemy, these, you know,
being the cavalry, who every day, I suppose, will
precede us out of camp and try to make it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
lively for us during the morning. A voice asks,
&#8220;Where are the cavalry?&#8221; and someone answers
&#8220;Intrenched,&#8221; which is not so foolish as it
sounds, they being equipped for the purpose, and
being drilled to fight dismounted. But intrenching
should not be necessary in a country provided, as
this one is, with stone walls. Other companies
are deploying on our left, and we wait before that
most dangerous of all attempts, a direct frontal
attack. The enemy, the captain has just explained,
is a half mile away across a slight depression.
At Bunker Hill our men waited till
they could see the whites of the red-coats&#8217; eyes.
At Fredericksburg our attacking men were helpless
at a hundred yards. But here as soon as we
have crossed the wall we shall be exposed to a
deadly fire, not only of rifles, but of machine guns.
Of these the enemy have two on motor tricycles,
and it is understood that the call of their sirens
is a signal that they are in action.
</p>
<p>(And again resting.)
</p>
<p>We have the machine guns, mother dear. The
cavalry got away, all but three or four of them.
This was how it went.
</p>
<p>When the field artillery had sufficiently pounded
the enemy (and having but few rounds this did
not last very long) we were given the order to
advance. First we went over the wall,&mdash;and you
must remember that every fence in this country,
stone, snake, or otherwise, is decorated with
barbed wire&mdash;and formed our line, lying flat, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
couple of rods beyond it. Now we put in practice
for the whole battalion the tactics we had
studied by platoons, sending men forward from
the right by squads in rushes, making a new line
by degrees, always keeping a constant fire on the
enemy&mdash;for we had a hundred rounds today, so
that if we were decently accurate we should make
him too nervous to be very dangerous in return.
We went about fifty yards at a time, our sergeants
and platoon leaders in the rear, behind them the
captain and his orderlies and behind all the major
and his aides. Certain officers with white bands
on their arms, who ventured unconcernedly into
the line of fire, I made out to be umpires judging
this game of war. For I find, mother dear, that
this is earnest for the officers as well as ourselves&mdash;we
and the enemy have maps, we know the
general conditions, and then each acts as in time
of war, trying to get the better of the opponent.
So that if an officer has properly trained his men,
and if in addition he shows good judgment, then
he can feel that he is advancing in his profession.
The major, working for the first time today with
a battalion under him (for last camp he was but
a captain) was as keen at the work as if real
bullets had been flying across the little valley.
Meanwhile the umpires, studying the strategy
of both sides, are themselves learning.
</p>
<p>Well, we got forward rush by rush, firing as we
lay waiting, getting ready at the word, and then
following Bannister as he quartered forward to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
the right or left to join the new line. As we neared
the stone wall behind which the enemy was firing
we could see his white hat-bands, when to my
disgust along came an umpire and ruled out the
rear rank. Wanting to be in at the death, I
changed places with Corder, who was &#8220;all in,&#8221; and
so I finished out the final charge, when the captain
came through the line with a rush and we
up and followed him yelling. The enemy very
obligingly vacated the wall as we approached,
and all we saw of the cavalry was their dust as
they departed, except a squad whom the umpires
called back.
</p>
<p>One machine gun I did not see, nor have I
heard how it was captured. But one was stalled
a little distance behind the wall, and I followed
the captain as he made for it. The two men on
it were swearing wonderfully, being regulars; the
captain snapped his pistol in the air as he ran,
and I likewise fired my gun upwards, it being the
rule of this campaign neither to fire nor to present
the bayonet at close quarters. Seeing they
could not get away, the men were actually ready
to fight, and I think had we been rookies we might
have had to scrap for it; but seeing an officer they
saluted and sullenly submitted.
</p>
<p>(In camp near Crossroads 75, south of Sciota,
N. Y., Tuesday evening.)
</p>
<p>I am sitting on a piece of canvas, being
one among a dozen or more men outside the
Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A. tent, all writing. Men constantly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
come between me and the light or step on my
outlying portions; there is much cheerful talking
and laughing, and all about is the usual bustle of
the camp.
</p>
<p>We arrived at camp late, as battle-scarred warriors,
and found the peaceful first battalion already
encamped. At once we pitched tents and
then hastily fed; at home, after hours of such
exertion, I should have had a half hour&#8217;s rest
before eating. But the food was ready and hot;
if I did not take it at once I could not get it at
all; so my stomach took the risk, and I had my
meal first and my rest afterward. Then a wash
in oh! such a soft-bottomed sluggish brook,
where many shaved, and others to my amazement
cleaned their teeth. For that ceremony I
keep my canteen water, which is served out to
us at the head of the company street in proper
dippers by orderlies; it is all I shall have, I foresee,
both for drink and for absolutely necessary
washing. We have better holding-ground for
our tent-pins tonight, but the sky is cloudless
and again we have not trenched. There are northern
lights&mdash;a change in weather? The hay today
cost but ten cents, and the adjutant assures us of
that tariff in future.
</p>
<p>Imagine the camp as yesterday, and me well.

<h2><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Extract from the Letter of Erasmus Corder,<br />Assistant-Professor of English, High<br />Private in Company H, 10th Training<br />Regiment, to His Wife. Same Date</span></h2>
</div>

<p> ... Instead of yesterday&#8217;s steady marching,
with the first battalion driving the enemy away
for our convenience, duties were today reversed,
and our battalion took the advance-guard work,
ending in a very bloody skirmish, in which, I
regret to report, one dear to you was slain. We
marched&mdash;and it was marching!&mdash;at a good pace
after the first few miles, having no one ahead to
hold us back except when we had to duck into the
roadside ditches to avoid machine-gun fire. Our
advance guard had died gallantly and cheered
(jeered?) us as we went forward to dislodge the
enemy. The problem was explained to us: the
enemy was 800 yards ahead, having command of
a shallow valley, which we must cross. This we
did by rushes, squads or platoons at a time, three
companies abreast no sooner achieving a new line
than they sent forward more feelers. In this
action it was very interesting for a time to simulate
real firing, shooting with blank cartridges at
an enemy behind a stone wall.
</p>
<p>And yet shooting from behind hard heaps of
stone, or lying on rough ground, through grass and
leaves that obscured the sights, all the time
troubled by a heavy pack that burdened the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
shoulders, poked the hat over the eyes, and hampered
the free action of the arms, began to wear
on me. Try as I may, I cannot master the little
sidewise shift of the pack which the captain showed
us, and which Godwin says makes shooting prone
&#8220;just as easy!&#8221; Looking at the other men, I
often saw them flop on their faces to rest; they
were working as hard as on the range. The pretense
of firing, when our cartridges were gone, took
away some of the excitement. Then at about
the fifth dash, which the others took with some
briskness but which I had to finish at a slow jog,
I began to get pumped. When the first sergeant
asked me how I was I told him that I was shot
through both lungs. Nevertheless, I finished
(though at a walk) the next to last charge, but
our dash had been so exposed that, by the time
I had thrown myself panting on some particularly
jagged stones, an umpire came along and announced
that all rear-rank men were to fall out,
of course as being dead. Godwin was disgusted,
and evidently seeing my envy in my face, swapped
places with me. Never was anyone so willing to
be killed. Quite at my leisure I watched the
spirited advance of the thin line of o. d. men to
storm the enemy&#8217;s position. And I was perfectly
willing not to be killed twice.
</p>
<p>Our little club of middle-aged men still holds
its impromptu sessions, members comparing experiences
and solicitously inquiring as to each
other&#8217;s condition. So far as I can see we are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
keeping up pretty well, except for the ability to
make such awful repeated dashes as today&#8217;s work
required. And even then a few minutes&#8217; rest sets
us on our feet again.
</p>
<p>Pitching the tents, making camp, etc., is now
routine work. The encampment is as picturesque
as before. Tomorrow night we also spend here;
whether or not we shall mercifully be permitted
to leave the tents pitched, the morning will decide.
But I am well, and blisterless, and refreshed, and
tomorrow shall be ready to die again.

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>You need not worry about my sleeping warm.
When I go to bed I take off my shoes and leggings,
put on an extra pair of socks, and crawl into the
bag which each afternoon I make up afresh by
pinning the folded blankets together with the
biggest safety pins you ever saw, and buttoning
my poncho around them. Over me thus there is
the poncho, and as many layers of blankets as I
please, up to five. Besides I have two sweaters,
if I need them. So I sleep snug.
</p>
<p>This morning it is pleasant and windless, as I
wait for the order to start.
</p>
<p>An instance of the change of orders under which
we labor. (As I recall the Civil War memoirs
that I have read, it seems to me that conditions
are much the same.) We were assembled in line
at 5.25, reported, stacked arms, and were ordered
(remember that we are to camp on this same
ground tonight) &#8220;Strike tents and make packs.
Make up blanket rolls and squad bags, and bring
them to the head of the street.&#8221; Oh, the disgust!
The orders were proper for the first battalion,
which marches on to Altona today; but for us
it seemed needless. But the promptest fell to
work, took down their tents, and began to make
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
up the packs. Then the word came travelling
down the street, &#8220;Leave tents standing!&#8221; Luckily
Bann and I had not got to the work of striking
the tent, and so we jubilated while some
others cussed. But we went on with making up
the rolls and bags. Then the order was transmitted,
&#8220;Leave blankets and extra kits in tents!&#8221;
Perhaps someone blundered in the first place, and
we got the order intended for the first battalion.
And I do not complain, for today we travel light,
with many things not in our packs.
</p>
<p>The call has come, &#8220;Squad leaders to the head
of the street.&#8221; That means a talk preparatory to
setting out. So I have put on my pack, so as to
wait without worry. Having marched very dry
yesterday, and a pebble which I hastily scooped
up proving large and rough, I have provided myself
(per one buzzard) with a package of chewing
gum. Oh for the old-fashioned spruce, with no
sweetness or artificial flavor!&mdash;The first battalion,
having packed entirely, is assembling for the
march. My map is buttoned in my shirt, for
consultation at halts. The day is warm, with
the wind from the west; but there are gathering
clouds, and I am going to use the time which is
left in digging with my bayonet a ditch around
the tent.
</p>
<p>(In West Sciota? At any rate, an inhabited
crossroads.) I am lying on my back in the wet
grass, while the captain explains that the sound
at a little distance, as of a lot of carpenters nailing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
at the boarding of a new house, is our patrols
firing at a party of cavalry that is opposing our
advance.
</p>
<p>We left our tents buttoned, and started out in
gray weather. I was glad that I had, with bayonet
and fingers, dug a shallow ditch along the
upper side of our pup and across the front, when
this light rain began. It is not bad, and so long
as I have my pack between me and the ground
I cannot get chilled. Again and again I have
used it so, and have seen fellows at halts napping
all around me. Truly the pack is a life saver.&mdash;&#8220;Fall in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>(North of Sciota, on the road to Mooers, near
crossroads 79, the weather now dry.) We are
resting after a skirmish, and as my position is
somewhat more comfortable, since I am lolling
in a ditch instead of lying on my back, perhaps
these jottings will be more legible than the last.
The skirmish went thus.
</p>
<p>We left our resting-place at crossroads 72, and
followed the popping of our advance guard, I
company, while at the same time we heard at a
greater distance the heavy firing of the first
battalion as it fought its way westward toward
Altona, we ourselves going north. As we advanced
beyond a corner, suddenly fire from the
left broke out upon the column behind us. At
once we were halted, and Captain Kirby, ranging
down the line of the company, picked out our
squad and sent us at the double over the fence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
and into the field north of the road that we had
passed, our enemy being in a thick wood to the
south of it. Here we streamed along, poor Corder
as usual soon being pumped and dropping behind,
while eager David was only kept from outdistancing
the rest by a sharp word from Knudsen.
We scrambled through a wire fence, then in a
pasture with scattered heavy cedars we assembled
behind a tree to survey the ground, all of us
pouring out our advice upon poor Bann&mdash;to go
to the road, to go further west, to plunge into the
woods and attack the enemy by ourselves. This
last from David, who is keen at every fight.
Someone urging to send a message back to the
captain, Bann got out the brand-new despatch
book and pencil which since the conference this
morning had been sticking out of his pocket, but
put them up again for lack of something definite
to say. So he took us across the road and into
the field behind the enemy&#8217;s wood, where it being
evident that the foe had no reserves, Bann
began once more to write.
</p>
<p>Now we heard Kirby&#8217;s voice, who having led
the company along the road, and finding himself
plainly behind the enemy&#8217;s fire, was putting the
men, in squad columns, into the wood to search
them out. We climbed the wire fence and followed
through the densest undergrowth, where
poor Corder, stumbling behind and having to
protect his glasses, often found himself quite out
of sight of the man in front. But we were too
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
late. We heard shouts ahead, the firing ceased,
and when we desperately broke through the last
of the thicket and found ourselves in the
open, there stood a line of men with white bands
on their hats (the sign of the opposing forces)
quietly regarding us. Rumor said that they were
captured, and Squad 9, being first on the ground,
was feeling proud of their work. Then the rumor
ran that not only was the enemy not captured,
but we were killed. Squad 9 was cursing, &#8220;not
loud but deep,&#8221; when the captain came along and
was passionately appealed to. &#8220;We got them,&#8221;
he assured us. &#8220;They were firing away from us
when we broke through the wood. A single picket
on that flank, firing a single shot on seeing us,
would have saved them. And besides, we have
their horses. Sergeant Barker has just come in
reporting that he has the bunch.&#8221; Satisfied, we
marched out to our present resting-place.
</p>
<p>The cavalry has just emerged from their unsuccessful
ambush, with the two machine guns,
and have started northward in a hurry, an umpire
warning them, &#8220;You have only five minutes
before we start after you.&#8221; The men around me
are laughing and talking, well content, and I
have just seen the major congratulating the captain
on a brisk piece of work.
</p>
<p>(In camp again, and settled for the night at
our old tents, the weather having cleared.)
</p>
<p>A cavalryman (by the way, there was pointed
out to me today the fellow with the broken jaw,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
jouncing along with the rest, and looking neither
thin nor pale) a cavalryman has just settled down
to discuss the skirmish with us. &#8220;We got some
beautiful shots at you fellows. In our first position
we let the point of I company walk by, and then
fired into them at about fifty yards. I company
drove us, and then we settled in that little wood,
with the machine guns. I company&#8217;s flanking
patrol came right up to the edge of the woods
without seeing us. We let them go by and then
fired into you. Didn&#8217;t you duck into the ditches
quick!&#8221; He is talking now of a cavalryman&#8217;s
work. &#8220;Here you fellows are grumbling because
you have a gun to clean. I wish I got off as
easily. I have my gun and my equipment; it
takes a lot of time, and today I had to clean and
water two horses, another fellow&#8217;s and mine.
The other man got hurt, one of the regulars. His
horse fell on him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The major, at conference, told us that he and
Captain Kirby had been expecting an attack at
that point, as the lay of the land was right for it.
They were surprised when the flanking patrol
found nothing.
</p>
<p>Our next work was quite different, and illustrates
the fact that the man in the ranks can only
tell what he sees, and often cannot understand
that. On our fresh advance northward our
company was the advance guard, I company
falling to our rear. The first platoon marched
ahead as the &#8220;point,&#8221; with communicating files,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
and we watched its operations for a while as we
followed along.
</p>
<p>The work of the &#8220;point,&#8221; my dear mother,
when you are advancing to engage the enemy,
is one of the most dangerous in warfare. When
the Germans sent out their advance guards as
they overran Belgium, they considered that the
men in each point had been given their death
warrants. The object of the point, as it proceeds
along the road, is to hunt for the enemy and engage
him. The men of the detail march at intervals
of about twenty-five yards on alternate
sides of the road, the corporal about halfway of
the squad, and the rearmost, or &#8220;get-away man,&#8221;
having the task of falling back as soon as any
serious obstacle is encountered, in order to communicate
with the support. As in enemy&#8217;s country
the roads are likely to be waylaid, patrols are
sent out to investigate any flanking hill, or wood,
or group of buildings, behind which a party could
be hiding. You can imagine the grim interest in
trying to walk into an ambuscade. I company&#8217;s
patrols having failed to locate the enemy in his
last concealment, we were particularly anxious to
make no such error.
</p>
<p>As we marched up each rise in ground I could
see the point ahead of us, and the patrols working
their way through the country to the right and
left of the road. As the point naturally went
faster than the patrols it would gradually leave
them behind, the corporal or sergeant commanding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
would send back for more men, the message
would come through the communicating files,
and men would be sent ahead for the work. Patrols
outdistanced, and still finding nothing, would
drop back to the road and rejoin their command
as soon as they could.
</p>
<p>After a while this work of the point had used
up the first platoon, and began to eat into ours.
It was then recalled and our platoon took its
place, with Squad 6 as point, Squad 7 providing
the patrols and communicating files, and our
squad as immediate reserve. Word coming for
more men, Clay and Reardon were sent forward,
and I saw them despatched off to the right, Clay
toward a nearby sugar-bush, a little grove with
its sugar house at its edge, and Reardon further
forward, toward a suspicious hollow behind which
was a railroad embankment which might conceal
a regiment. I was plainly among the next to
go, and waited impatiently. Then we halted,
and remained so for some time.
</p>
<p>The men grumbled. Why stop? Why wasn&#8217;t
the support following more closely? Where was
the enemy, anyway? Hoping to be right in the
middle of the next scrap, we were disappointed
at any delay. Meanwhile Clay, having found
nothing in his sugar-bush, returned, and attention
was fixed on our flanking patrol to the left, who
having discovered that we had stopped, likewise
became stationary, and leaving un-rummaged
the thick little growth of birch ahead of him, sat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
himself down in the midst of an apple orchard,
and visibly regaled himself on something red.
</p>
<p>This was exasperating, we having already had
to leave untouched so many trees laden with
fruit. Roars from the sergeant failing to dislodge
our resting patrol, a man was starting out to order
him on, when he was observed to start, crouch
behind a tree, make ready to shoot, and then to
fall back from cover to cover, continually presenting
his gun at an unseen enemy. He rejoined us
out of breath, and feverishly reported having
heard men in the scrub, and a voice ordering him
to surrender. The sergeant was hastily sending
out our squad to investigate the birches, when a
bunch of men were seen to break cover from them.
As they wore no white hat-bands we knew they
must be our men; and when they came nearer we
saw them to be Squad 9, which a quarter hour
before the captain had despatched on special
flanking duty, and which, being full of energy,
had done their work and more too, coming back
after a practical joke on our patrol.
</p>
<p>And then we were ordered to return! Instead
of the support marching to fill the gap between us,
we were to go back to it. Bannister objected that
a man was missing, Reardon through excess of
zeal having vanished in the distance along the
railroad. &#8220;Send out a man after him,&#8221; said the
sergeant. All the squad offered to go; Corder
was a little the slowest, being leg-weary, but who
do you think was first? David! So he was despatched,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
and went very eagerly, while we turned
our backs and went south.
</p>
<p>When the company had joined the battalion
there was much rearranging of disjointed commands,
squads continually coming in from detail
duty, so that it was plain that between us we
had pretty well investigated the whole landscape.
David and Reardon were missing still, even after
we had rested for some time. We started south
again, and it was not till after another march
that the lost men rejoined us, David triumphant,
but Reardon very hot and weary. Said the poor
fellow, &#8220;I have thought before now that I was
pretty tired, but this beats everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no rest for him, however. We
turned north again, having J company in front,
and after a mile heard the familiar firing. The
captain sent us headlong into the field on the
right, where soon we were part of a skirmish line,
and for a minute were blazing away at a fence
in front of us, behind which I glimpsed a single
white hat-band. But Kirby was not to be caught
as the cavalry had allowed themselves to be.
Squad 8 was sent off at the double to the end of
the line, and there at wide intervals we made a
flank guard extending to the rear, where poor
Reardon was allowed to rest at last, as we waited
hidden behind what cover we could find, gazing
across some pasture land with scattered bushes
at a belt of pine in front.
</p>
<p>As we waited we heard the voice of an umpire;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
I snatched a glimpse of him as he stood behind
us watching. &#8220;Any enemy you see represents
twenty-five men.&#8221; A cool statement that made
our task perplexing, for while with one bullet I
might slay so many men, conversely if one shot
at us first he could wipe out the squad. But
though we lay very low and watched very keenly,
while the battalion banged away at our left, no
one appeared in front of us. To my left was
Reardon, and to my right David, very intent
on spotting the first foe. It is a pleasure to
see how seriously he takes the work. Pickle,
beyond him, was constantly chewing gum and
whispering slang, the sort of city clerk one reads
about in Civil War memoirs, tough physically
and mentally.
</p>
<p>(I have thrown my chewing gum away. Too
much swallowing of saliva makes you (me!) hungry.
Me for a pebble from the next brook!)
</p>
<p>We were at last called back by a whistle, and
the distant cry, &#8220;Assemble on the left!&#8221; Once
more we marched south, and presently were
resting again at West Sciota. As we lolled there,
buying apples from native buzzards, who take
to the extortion of the professional without any
coaching, some trucks came to the crossroads,
and men began to climb into them. Watching
one group, I was surprised to recognize a man of
A company, at the same time that Corder exclaimed,
&#8220;Those men are from the first battalion!&#8221;
whose firing, you remember, we had already
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
heard at least a couple of miles away. We
did not get the explanation until battalion conference,
some hours later. It seems that the umpires,
during our northward march, had reinforced
the cavalry with an imaginary battalion of infantry,
before which we had been obliged to retreat.
By motorcycle messenger a call for help
was sent to the first battalion commander, who
was now four miles away on the road to Altona.
Having sixteen empty motor-trucks, in four minutes
he had filled them with two companies, and
seventeen minutes later they were behind our
lines, forming for our support. As we saw or
guessed none of this, it only illustrates the remark
with which I began, that the private soldier knows
but a little of what is going on.
</p>
<p>I would not write this to you in such detail,
except that I think it will interest you to see that
the hike is more than a mere march, and that it
is making every one of us advance in his department
of the war game. We squads, I hope, are
learning to do as we are told, though you see how
blind everything is to us. The intricate problems
of the officers come out in conference. There
the men sit on the ground in a great three-quarter-circle,
grouping themselves whenever possible
around the men with maps. The major likewise
has hisn, and the officers theirn. The major makes
a general statement of the work of the day, and
the captains then report on their particular operations.
When you see what exact notes they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
have taken of every operation: the precise moment
of sending out parties and of receiving reports,
the minuteness with which they locate every
action, the science with which they carry out the
work that falls to them, and the team-play that
animates them, you see that this is no old-style
cut-and-dried &#8220;sham battle,&#8221; but an actual study,
of course on a small scale, of fighting seriously
carried out by well-trained officers. It has deeply
impressed me with the long and hard work necessary
to make an officer; and then, turning to
the man&#8217;s side of it, it becomes plainer and
plainer that it takes time, much time, to train
a private or a corporal into a reliable man on
patrol.
</p>
<p>One hard thing for us amateurs to learn is the
proper writing of messages containing military information.
It is hard to decide what is important
enough to send, and then how to word the
despatch. Tradition from an earlier camp has
handed down this model: &#8220;The enemy are in
sight and are about to do something.&#8221; Where,
when, how many, some notion, however vague, of
the enemy&#8217;s disposition&mdash;all forgotten between excitement
and too great responsibility.
</p>
<p>The march home was the hardest part of the
day. The interest of the skirmish kept us going;
but the three miles back to camp at a quick
pace took it out of us all. I had not known I was
so tired; the strain wore hard on me; it seemed
ages before we sighted camp, and then ages and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
ages before we reached it. But this experience
was the same as on Monday, for though the very
vigorous ones were able to whistle and sing, to
the help of us all, again I began to hear grumbling
all about me. We reached camp at last, and poor
Reardon when we broke ranks dropped on the
ground at his tent door, without the energy to
unbutton the flaps, and in a minute was fast
asleep there.
</p>
<p>We had our dinner, which I put in my meat-can
under the hay to keep hot while I rested,
then ate and felt refreshed. Then the afternoon
we had to ourselves, if you can so consider it
when we have to clean our guns, clean ourselves,
come to conference, and come to Retreat. For
my own part, having yesterday sampled the
slimy brook and having no taste for it again, I
washed my face and hands (after cleaning my
gun) in a little water from the canteen. Thus I
am staying dirty. It is no more than I have done
before, in the deep woods.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was some hike we had this morning,&#8221;
calls Bannister to a friend across the street.
Such is the general opinion, especially Reardon&#8217;s,
who slept till he had to be roused for conference.
And I want especially to chronicle that it was
David who, declaring that Reardon would get
rheumatism from the bare ground, roused him
enough to get him onto his blankets in the tent;
it was David who sat by him and prevented anyone
from waking him; and it was David who after
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
cleaning his own gun, which work the lad does
not enjoy, cleaned Reardon&#8217;s.
</p>
<p>The story goes now that the stolen clip of ball
cartridges has been found and confiscated. Its
location is ascribed to every company in the regiment,
including ours. Our blanks we use very
freely, being supplied every morning with any
number from fifty up. And wherever we shoot
them in any quantity, buzzards still flock together
to rummage in the underbrush.
</p>
<p>You ask the meaning of Retreat. It is the last
ceremony of the military day, when the colors
are furled. The companies are called together,
each at the end of its street, so that they are in
order one behind the other. Sometimes we are
drilled in the manual, sometimes we have rifle
inspection; but as soon as the bugle sounds the
warning call we come to parade rest. Then the
band plays the Star Spangled Banner, after which
we stand at attention while the bugler plays the
beautiful &#8220;To the Colors.&#8221; The flag is furled, and
everyone not in line, cooks, orderlies, all except
the buzzards, likewise stand at attention during
the call, and at the end salute. Then promptly
we are dismissed and allowed to hope for supper.
</p>
<p>Our diet is the same monotony of wholesome,
plentiful food. I am flourishing on it; Corder is
proud of requiring nothing else. On the other
hand some complain, and Pickle, having a sweet
tooth, at the end of a meal will often go out and
feed himself with boughten pies and doughnuts.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
For you must understand that not only do the
buzzards follow us from camp to camp, but every
farmer&#8217;s wife along the line of march or near our
camp bakes a batch of her favorites and puts out
a sign. Those along the road must be disappointed;
none of us ever fall out. But they make
a good sale outside the camp. David, who has
become very strict with himself, is trying to save
Pickle from his indulgences, but so far without
success except that Pickle has become very sly
about slipping away.

</p>
<p>The camp has been policed down to the last
cigarette stub and gun patch, or anything else
that the captain&#8217;s keen eye might light on. The
call has gone out, &#8220;Platoon leaders to the head of
the street,&#8221; and the day&#8217;s work is to be laid out
for them. We privates have been studying our
maps. For we expect to march to Altona, where
last night the first battalion camped, and we
suspect that they will march out and oppose us.
It is only seven miles by road, but no one knows
how long if skirmishing is added.
</p>
<p>After mailing my letter last night I sat among
others at the captain&#8217;s fire, listening to his ready
answers to the questions which we fired at him.
We went over points of strategy, and discussed
the day&#8217;s work. It has become plain to me that
there is a great advantage in so small a camp as
ours, a regiment of but six companies. We can
be in or pretty close to every scrap that happens,
and all the real military problems are fairly plain
to us. Besides, this hike is to be the longest yet.
When further you consider that a month of Plattsburg
has as many hours of service as a militiaman
gets in two years and a half at home, that our
continuous service is naturally much more valuable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
than the militiaman&#8217;s weekly drill in his
armory, and finally that we are under West
Pointers who each day explain and discuss the
problem, you can see that a man in the Tenth
Regiment has a chance to learn a good deal.
</p>
<p>Little absurdities are taking place around me.
Says Corder, struggling with his pack, &#8220;Bann,
will you help me into my corset.&#8221; Pickle says to
Reardon (out of David&#8217;s hearing) &#8220;Ten cents for
a bum piece of pie that you have to eat with your
hands! That gets my goat.&#8221; And just now has
come a hoot from every part of the camp when
from I company, in line to start and loading guns
for a skirmish, sounded the pop of an accidental
discharge. But the men of I company look sour
and glum.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless I will admit that I discovered
yesterday from personal experience, but luckily
in the rattle and banging of a fight, how the gun
is accidentally discharged. You draw back the
bolt and push it forward again, thus putting a
cartridge in the barrel. Then you turn the bolt
down. Now if in so doing your third or fourth
finger strays inside the trigger guard and presses
the trigger (and it is very easily done) then&mdash;!
But no one could hear my mistake in all the
firing.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>(<i>Resting after battle, near Altona.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>We marched for some miles unmolested along
our westward road, and the amateur strategists
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
among us scanned each rise of ground ahead, predicting
fights. But when the row finally began
we were too far in the rear to see just what kind
of position the enemy had decided to hold. As
often happens, we were ordered into the ditch to
wait, while the officers consulted briefly, and all
the time the rattle of the guns kept up. Half
the cavalry, by the way, were with us, and we
saw them sent off by a woodroad to the left,
supposedly to flank the enemy. Then for our
platoon occurred one of our occasional bawlings
out. As we waited, having loaded, we saw the
4th, 3d, and 1st platoons ordered over the fence
into the field on our right. Being used to seeing
the company split into its detachments for different
purposes, and hearing no orders, we remained
placidly in the ditch&mdash;for we are now old soldiers,
and are learning not to hunt trouble. But the
lieutenant came running, and with a few sharp
words deftly removed the scalp of our leader, and
retired with it at his belt. So over we scrabbled,
and took our place in the column. Then
we wandered miles through pastures, woods, and
bogs, at first in <i>column of squads</i>, which means
four men abreast, and then, as the going became
difficult, in <i>squad columns</i>, which means eight
men following each other in single file. Note
this difference&mdash;I wish we had! At one time, for
nearly a mile, the whole company was in Indian
file, winding through the underbrush.
</p>
<p>And as we went thus there came a curious little
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
test of character and discipline. For to us as we
halted at one charming bit of stony hillside, cedar
grown, came one of the amazing persistent buzzards
carrying his whole stock in trade, a box of
chocolate bars. We were hungry, and some men
bought; even David began fumbling in his pocket
as the man came near. But he looked at Knudsen,
and the Swede frowned, so when the fellow
offered his wares David waved him away. Having
shown weakness, he did not attempt to influence
Pickle; but that worthy, with a sigh, put up
his money. &#8220;War is hell,&#8221; said he, and cursed the
buzzard. None in our squad bought; in fact,
though the captain was not in sight, I think the
buzzard was disappointed in F company.
</p>
<p>Firing was all the time very noisy to our left,
and as we moved on it was plain that we were
skirting the centre of the scrimmage in an attempt
to take the enemy in flank. Now our
squad columns were sent forward parallel, eight
yards apart, ready at command to spring out in
one long line, the men side by side. Through a
cedar swamp we now made our way among huge
old trees, the firing very hot and close in front,
until we were halted at the edge of the thicket,
with an open space in front across which was a
snake fence some thirty yards away. As we waited
the order to advance, we being on the extreme
right, a railroad embankment just beyond us,
we saw a platoon rush forward from the left,
cross the open diagonally, and line the fence in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
front of us. With objurgations the captain and
lieutenant coaxed them again to the left. Other
platoons, and perhaps single squads, rushed from
cover and occupied the fence, the whole line beginning
to fire.
</p>
<p>We felt sure that it was our turn next, and were
saying so, when apparently the order came. The
platoon leader sprang out in front, I made up my
mind where I was to go, we all surged forward,
crossed the open space, and I presently found
myself in the line, firing across the fence at a
distant wall, the range of which I calculated to be
but a hundred yards, and therefore used &#8220;battle
sight,&#8221; firing low. But here came the lieutenant
again, scalped our leader a second time, and ordered
us back. So I trailed back across the open
ground and meekly took my place with the others
again in squad column. We asked each other,
&#8220;Weren&#8217;t we ordered forward?&#8221; Some declared
that the platoon leader had ordered the advance,
others that the lieutenant had sent us out. I
knew I had heard his voice, but really I had merely
followed on like a sheep. That was proper. But
at any rate here was a time when the platoon-leader
had made a mistake in keeping us with the
rest of the company.
</p>
<p>While the platoon, thirty-four men of us, was
huddled in its special bunch of trees, all talking
and explaining, along in haste came the major,
dismounted, demanding if we were in column of
squads. With one voice we maintained that we
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
were, but he or his aide knew better, and by the
help of our two sergeants bringing the corporals
to their senses and silencing the men, we were
finally got out of our squad columns, in which
formation we had been so long that we had forgotten
that there was any other. In column of
squads we were swung to the right, put in skirmish
line, and halted below the railway embankment,
where the major, with great patience and
the most painstaking English, explained to our
limited intelligences the exact man&oelig;uvre that he
contemplated. Then at the word we rushed the
embankment, plunged into a ditch, swung to the
left, some of us across a wire fence, and prepared
to advance and annihilate a bunch of the enemy
that we saw before us. But they sending out a
messenger, explained that they were dead, which
saved us the trouble, not really to our pleasure,
for having made fools of ourselves we were anxious
to take it out on somebody. And then the bugle
blew Recall.
</p>
<p>Green troops in battle would cause just such
confusion and delay. It was very evident that
we had spoiled some plan. The need of a soldier&#8217;s
training would be plain to anyone that heard the
babble of our voices in that corner, conjecturing,
advising, urging this and that. We are still very
far from the state in which we could be trusted
to go into battle and obey every order just as it
came. The reasons for this I figure out to be two.
</p>
<p>In the first place I have learned that the so-called
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
intelligent volunteer, while able with surprising
quickness to master the manual and the
drill, with the rudiments of skirmish work, and
all because of his trained mind, nevertheless does
not readily give up his independence of thought
except in the presence of men whom he recognizes
as his unquestionable professional superiors.
Hence, when deprived of such guidance, each
man has his own theory and his own advice, which
he voices without modesty.
</p>
<p>Secondly, while in the regular army such situations
are readily controlled by the&mdash;(To be

<p>by the non-commissioned officers, it was very
evident today that ours had not sufficient control
over us because they had not sufficient control
over themselves. They were new to their responsibility,
and did not understand how to
handle the particular problem. And if we had
needed another example of what was lacking, it
was at hand in a few minutes when on our way
to camp, and seeing the tents in plain view across
a stream, the captain decided to save us a half-hour
by fording. So he led the way down into the
water, the lieutenant at his side discussing, tramped
across the shallow river, and marched on, whether
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
forgetting us or testing us I do not know. The
first squad or two followed gamely, the next
faltered, and all the rest spread out in confusion
and tried to cross dry-shod. I am glad to say
that Squad 8 hung together, hopped over quickly,
formed and went on. After a hundred yards we
came up with the captain, who was just sending
back a sergeant with the message, &#8220;Help all the
girls across.&#8221; When once we were assembled he
gave us his solemn promise never to try to save us
work again.
</p>
<p>What would prevent such blunders in future?
I will admit that in each such case non-coms from
the regular army would have steadied us and
kept us right. Yet I am convinced that what will
best control the Plattsburg rookie is the Plattsburg
non-com. All we need is to develop a body
of them. The regular may serve at a pinch, but
in the cases where moral control is more needed
than a little knowledge or habitual steadiness, the
appeal comes strongest from a man of our own
kind.
</p>
<p>I suppose that only the shower saved us from
an awful roasting at the conference.
</p>
<p>The camp is rather picturesquely situated in a
broad field that stretches down to swamps and
woods, the cavalry at a slight distance across a
little swale. Our squad was on police duty for a
while, and I was orderly for an hour. The lady
buzzards of the town have spread a chicken dinner,
at a dollar a head, in the town hall, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
many of our fellows have slipped away to it. Yet
at dinner-time I saw poor Pickle sitting by the
water-barrel, a plate of beans in his lap. I asked
innocently, &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you at the chicken dinner?&#8221;
&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask foolish questions,&#8221; he snapped.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t you see I&#8217;m tied here to serve out water?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I went for my bath down to our little river,
which bears the imposing name of the Great
Chazy; it wanders idle from pool to pool along its
half dry bed. In one of the natural bath-tubs I
had a fine wash, finding a pool up to my knees,
clear cold water where minnows swam trustingly
about, and where crawfish, the first I have ever
seen, came like little pink lobsters to investigate
my toes. After the stagnant brooks at our last
two camps, it was delightful to find this clear
water and actually get <i>under</i> it.
</p>
<p>I was so trustful of the weather that I washed
a pair of socks, but I had not got into my clothes
before a shower started. I took refuge, with
another man, in a cavalry officer&#8217;s tent. We had
a pleasant little chat with him; he did not resent
the intrusion of a couple of rookies, and we talked
of camp matters. Intermittently it has been
raining ever since.

David says in my ear, &#8220;Damn him, I meant to
get even with him!&#8221; This for Reardon&#8217;s sake,
who laughs at David&#8217;s energy, yet I think is
rather touched by it. We have had our usual
talk with the captain at the company fire, and
rather gently he has pointed out to us our shortcomings,
especially our platoon&#8217;s in giving the
major such trouble.
</p>
<p>But some men of our platoon came to him with
a grievance. In getting us into our column of
squads someone swore at the men, and they attributed
the profanity to the major&#8217;s aide, a
volunteer like ourselves. This roused the captain.
&#8220;No one shall swear at my men!&#8221; he declared,
his gentleness all gone. &#8220;I will talk with
that aide.&#8221; That obliged me to speak. &#8220;Captain,&#8221;
said I, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to disagree with the
others, but as I happened to have admired the
coolness of the aide, it doesn&#8217;t seem to me that he
was in a state of mind to swear.&#8221; One of our
sergeants spoke up. &#8220;I might have done it, sir.
I was a little excited.&#8221; The man has sworn at us
before, and Knudsen has resented it. The captain
was mollified by the admission, but he read
the man a little lecture. &#8220;Never swear at your
men, sir. Apart from the fact that it does no
good, it&#8217;s most unsoldierlike. I never swore at
an enlisted man but once, when I was a very
young officer, and I never will again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I must stop because of the damp and the discomfort,
writing in this flickering light, my legs,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
as usual, cramped. I despair of ever conveying
a proper idea of this rainy evening, the indifference
of the hardy ones, the dejection of the sensitive,
crowding together wherever there is cover,
trying to keep dry at fires, or in final surrender
crawling into their beds, to wait the hours through.
It is not raining at this moment, but I am curious
to know what the night will bring. The tent is
pretty well ditched, but the pin at my shoulder is
very loose in this sandy soil, and if it showers&mdash;!
Good night.

</p>
<p>The night, in spite of its possibilities, was not
bad. I went to bed in the rain, Bann already
snoozing by my side, and was put to sleep by the
sounds of men&#8217;s voices murmuring. Roused by a
smart shower, I heard Taps blown, and the top
sergeant going up and down the street. &#8220;Cut out
that talking, men!&#8221; Waking in the night I found
the sky clear, the wind blowing, and two pins
out at my side, with the tent flapping. I put the
pins in, but when next I was waked by the rain
in my face the side of the tent was flapping
heavily, and nothing but the fact that instead of
a rifle for the tent pole we used a stake, driven
about six inches into the ground, had saved us
from a collapse. I held down the corner through
the shower, then opening my meat-can, used its
long handle for a tent-peg. If our little pins
were a couple of inches longer this nuisance could
be prevented. The new peg held till morning,
the clouds then gradually breaking for a glorious
sunrise.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><i>On a hillside, near Ellenburg Depot.</i></p>
</div>

<p>We rolled our moist blankets, made up our
damp packs, ate our hasty breakfasts, and with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
I company were hustled into motor trucks, two
squads to a truck. For forty-five minutes we
jolted and squashed over bad roads, and finally
bowled along over macadam. After eight or ten
miles we were turned out, and marched in the
cloudy, windy morning three miles to Ellenburg
Depot. Here we left a man on each bridge, to
notify pursuers that it was destroyed, and turned
into the fields, at last climbing a ridge from which,
to the left, we saw at a distance a high hill, its
wooded sides beginning to show the mottled reds
of autumn, while just below our steep slope lay
a wide flat bottom, perfect green, with a brook
wandering through it. Here we rested, delighting
in the view but shivering in the wind, while the
company officers and the major looked over the
ground. Then the orders were, &#8220;Off with the
equipment, get out your tools, and dig a trench.&#8221;
The front rank is working like beavers now, and
as our turn is nearly here, I must stop this scribbling.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '><i>In camp near Ellenburg Depot, Friday afternoon.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Again I sit in the tent while outside it rains.
We have as yet been able to get no straw, for
though I have twice hurried at the first glimpse of
a wagon, the fellows nearer got it all. The ground
is wet from this morning&#8217;s rain, my pen has
splashed everything with ink, and I am afraid
that this rain is no mere shower. But thank
Heaven! the soil is better for the pins to hold in,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
the tents have all been faced away from the wind,
we have had a most interesting morning, and I
have a full stomach. To resume my story:
</p>
<p>Considerably below the crest of the hill, and
perhaps seventy feet uphill from a railway cutting,
a line was marked, and the men fell to at the
digging with enthusiasm. The ground was sandy,
and we quickly threw out the soil, and heaved
out the occasional big rocks. &#8220;We&#8221; scarcely includes
poor Corder, who complained bitterly
that his appearance of age made the fellows keep
the tools from him; but when we were ordered
to bring stones and turf, he joyfully carried burdens.
The trench was dug about four feet deep,
with an eighteen inch parapet outside. Inside
this was a shelf for an elbow rest; the parapet was
lined (revetted, the captain said) with flat stones,
and finally the whole outside was turfed, so that
the raw earth did not show. The turf was from
ground opened in a long line higher up the hill,
and left open to look like a trench and draw the
enemy&#8217;s fire. Our trench being finished, another&mdash;a
mere rifle pit, higher up the slope&mdash;was made
for the captain&#8217;s observation post, and still another
for a northerly outpost. Having turfed
the outside of these, we picked the milkweed stalks
that stood in great numbers, and set them at
proper intervals with artistic irregularity, while
for the captain was provided a little bush. I
company&#8217;s trenches were further to the south.
</p>
<p>We were finishing, and Corder had just said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
&#8220;We need a shower to clean this dirty turf,&#8221;
when the shower came. The captain ordered us
into our packs and ponchos, and then into the
trench. Though the shower was short the wind
was increasingly cold, and I was glad of the protection
of my poncho. For in that trench we
remained for an hour and three quarters, before
anything really happened.
</p>
<p>I had time to study a good many things. The
depth to which grass roots will go in sandy soil:
at least two feet. The amount of sand that gets
into the lock of one&#8217;s rifle. The continual discomfort
of sand blowing into one&#8217;s eyes. The
cold that strikes up through the stone, or the
sand, on which one sits. The personality of my
neighbor of Squad Nine, who seemed much less
interested in his life as a banker than I was. The
incalculable value of the pack as a life-saver, for
having to lean against the wall of the narrow
trench, nothing but the roll on my back kept me
from the deadly chill of pneumonia. But most
interesting of all was the behavior of the men.
</p>
<p>As we worked at digging the trench we naturally,
being intelligent volunteers, had many
sub-directors, and much grumbling at so much
unofficial ordering. Randall, during one of his
rests, delivered himself with much disgust. &#8220;There
never was an American,&#8221; said he, &#8220;who could
take orders. Each man thinks he knows best.
We need to learn to obey.&#8221; Well, once we were
down in the trench, it was Randall&#8217;s head that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
was continually popping up, and continually being
ordered down; and it was Randall who would
light cigarettes, though ordered not to. An hour
and three quarters is a long time to wait, and the
cramped space was very tiring. Further, we were
excited by the sound of firing, I suppose from the
driving in of the detachment which the lieutenant
had taken off to the east, so of course
everyone wanted to see. In addition, our two
sergeants, who have none too much authority,
were together at one end of the platoon, away
from the most impatient of the men, and so were
quite unable to control Randall and other restless
spirits. Randall, arguing that no one could
see <i>him</i>, would pop up his head, others imitated,
and so on the whole a fine example of discipline
our platoon made. But David, lost in wonder at
such wilfulness, never raised his head above the
parapet.
</p>
<p>Well, at last we heard the captain&#8217;s whistle,
and steadied. His voice came: &#8220;Range, eight
hundred and fifty yards.&#8221; We set our sights.
&#8220;At one o&#8217;clock, to the right of the cemetery,
fire at will!&#8221; We stood upright (it was a relief
to straighten out!) and I saw, across the valley,
beside a little cemetery on the top of the further
hill, some moving figures, at which I fired a couple
of clips. Then &#8220;Cease firing!&#8221; We locked our
pieces; the men had disappeared. &#8220;Down, men!&#8221;
And we crouched again. But next we heard
&#8220;Battle sight&mdash;at four o&#8217;clock&mdash;fire at will,&#8221; and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
when we stood up there was a line of skirmishers
advancing out of the woods beyond the railway
cutting, about where the figure four would be on
a great clock-face if spread before us on the landscape,
we ourselves being at the six. But while I
was popping contentedly away at these men our
platoon was ordered first to cease firing, and then
to leave the trench and rush to the top of the hill,
which we did helter-skelter, none, not even our
leader, knowing why.
</p>
<p>At the very ridge we were met, slap in the face,
by a fierce wind of which we in the trench had as
yet got no inkling, which blew our ponchos all
about, and savagely drove heavy drops of rain
in our eyes. In the midst of this surprise we were
confronted by an orderly, who pointing along
the ridge, told us that we were to form in column
of squads. In which direction we should face,
and which squad first, 7 or 10, he did not say. It
is easy enough now to see what our leader should
have done. He should have said: &#8220;Men, get
down out of the line of the enemy&#8217;s (highly imaginary)
fire. Now, my good messenger, what are
my orders? And meanwhile, my wise privates,
keep silence.&#8221; But nothing of the sort. There we
stayed on the ridge, and there we finally formed
in column of squads, all the time in full view of
the enemy, who might have potted the last man
of us. The major at last came to the rescue, got
us down from the ridge, and in the hearing of us
all roasted poor Jones quite as well as the lieutenant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
did yesterday. &#8220;If you have a brain, sir,
don&#8217;t use it. Stay in sight of the enemy and be
shot.&#8221; Then he sent us by a way I never should
have chosen in cold blood, across the top of a
steep slope, with sliding sand and loose stones
underfoot, while all the time the same wind and
rain whipped and beat us unmercifully. At last
we were halted behind another hill, put in skirmish
line, and told what we were to do. We were
to rush the ridge, then to run down to a trench
made and occupied by our engineers, while they,
being worn out by many days of fighting in it,
were to vacate it. We executed the order smartly,
dashing down to the trench, the engineers, at
sight of us, scrambling out and running for cover.
I found myself jumping down into a trench as
deep as my shoulder, very finely made. Different
from our trench, which was protected from enfilading
only by cross walls at intervals, this
trench zigzagged; moreover, its parapet was
wattled. The engineers must have worked at it
from early dawn, unless they brought their hurdles
with them.
</p>
<p>(There, I have at last got my hay!)
</p>
<p>Well, there was but little more. A man emerging
on a distant slope, commanding a ridge along
which any successful attack must come, I hit him
squarely in the middle, only to discover when too
late that he was an umpire. Two of our fellows
claimed to have shot a buzzard, and contended for
the honor. When at last we saw real enemies,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
two platoons coming into full view below us, we
shot them all to pieces. An umpire told them that
they were dead, whereupon they formed in line
and went through the manual of arms, to get themselves
warm. Then we were collected and marched
back, triumphant. It seems that we were told
that if we held our line till one o&#8217;clock, we won.
It was past the hour, and our victory was complete.
We marched to camp in good spirits, being
especially pleased to hear the major (the opposing
major!) compliment Captain Kirby on the excellence
of his trench. <i>Our</i> trench! We finished
two hundred and fifty feet in an hour and twenty
minutes. We are told that the trench was quite
invisible, even after we had begun firing, and
that we were betrayed only by the white bands
on our hats.
</p>
<p>I have talked with one of the men who was left
at a bridge to tell any pursuers that it was blown
up. He said that it gave him great pleasure to
loll on the railing and watch a platoon ford the
cold stream up to their waists.
</p>
<p>With great relief I left the ground. We have so
carefully policed each camping place that I had
awful visions of having to fill in the trenches and
replace the sod. But by some arrangement with
the owner of the land we left the trenches as
memorials of our great fight. How many cows will
they trap, I wonder.
</p>
<p>Our breakfast was at six, and we had no lunch
till two o&#8217;clock. Whether we were hungry? In
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
spite of this settled cold rain, which curiously is
from the west, the men are in good spirits, though
they show it by yowling at every bugle call that
summons them out.
</p>
<p>This letter is written up to date, and so I&#8217;ll
close it. Love from

</p>
<p>Yesterday I said to Knudsen, while David listened,
&#8220;The trouble with our platoon is that we
don&#8217;t particularly care for our sergeants, and have
got into the way of <i>knocking</i> them. I&#8217;ve done
more or less of it myself. Now it may be no
more than they deserve, but it&#8217;s bad for our discipline
and our work. Don&#8217;t you suppose we
could turn about and help the sergeants more?
If you should lead in it, it would make a difference
in the whole platoon, for I notice that everyone
wants to know your opinion.&#8221; David&#8217;s face
showed that he approved, so Knudsen agreed,
and we three talking to our squad and Squad
Nine, have started a little Good Government Association.
I think today it did good.
</p>
<p>Last night was a long one for me. I am still
unable to get myself a woollen cap, and though I
used the felt hat for both the cold and the rain,
it rolled away at every excuse. To keep out the
rain, I had laid my poncho on the windward side
of the tent, buttoning it along the ridgepole; but
it slapped a good deal of the time. The entrance-flaps,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
which some of the fellows always button, I
had open for the air, and they thrashed all night.
Beside me Bann slept like a child; but I was
pretty damp when I went to bed, the rain and the
wind came through, and every little thing waked
me. Twice a peg pulled out, but the tent stood,
and I was able to put it in again. So the night
was long. Yet I got some sleep, and we were
surely better off than our opposite neighbors,
whose tent blew down soon after midnight, so
that they had to crawl out and set it up in the
dark and the driving rain.
</p>
<p>There are camp tales of all kinds of hardships.
Some stayed round the fires all night to keep
warm; some, their tents collapsing, took refuge on
a nearby piazza; some talk of washing their faces
this morning in hoar frost. But I <i>saw</i> none of this.
</p>
<p>The yowlings which usually greet the bugler
on any unwelcome occasion were absent this
morning, for most of us were ready to rise, or
already risen. There was at first only a drizzle,
in which I ate breakfast; it surely was better than
last night, with the steady rain running from my
hat into my stew as I bent over it, and cooling
as well as diluting it, besides searching out vulnerable
parts of my person, which a poncho does
not truly protect. Yesterday I set my things
down on a wet board; today I stood at the high
running-board of an auto-truck, a very desirable
position. Yet I thought my hands have seldom
been colder than when I stood in line this morning,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
unable to give them the protection of gloves or
pockets.
</p>
<p>In the same drizzle we broke camp, packed
our squad-bags and blanket-rolls, and made our
packs. It rained as we started, and the whole
outlook was bad&mdash;for to march ten miles in the
wet, and then to make camp under these same
conditions, was soldiering indeed.
</p>
<p>Yet ten minutes after we had left camp, the
advance guard of the battalion, we were staring
at each other in new dismay. For pop-pop! Our
point had found the enemy. Now for comfort a
skirmish ought to be fought near the new camping
ground: anticipation keeps us going till the fight
begins, and then at the end, weary, we have but a
short way to march. This was the deuce! In a
moment we were turned aside into a field, and
saw the white hat-bands beyond a fence in front.
First deployment, then &#8220;Down, men!&#8221; and flat
I threw myself into a six inch bed of clover, as
wet as a sponge. From this couch I fired for a
while, was ordered up, hurried with the squad
forward to a new line, flopped again, fired, and
then dashed once more.
</p>
<p>For two hours, mother, this sort of thing continued.
In a long line our company spread over
the fields, now one part advancing, then the rest.
Sometimes we were flat, sometimes we might
squat on cold stones behind a wall, sometimes we
were climbing walls and running forward. Discovering
that it was wetter below me than above,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
I hung my poncho at my hip, and when we flopped,
fell on it. We struck soft ground and formed in
squad columns, then came to a place where the
enemy was visible in a sugar-bush, across a ravine.
Down into the gully I plunged among the rest,
and in a confusion of men each seeking in a hurry
the best way across, got through two wire fences,
forced my way among a growth of alders, and
splashed through a brook, luckily no deeper than
my ankles. Then up the steep slope, and as soon
as the platoon was gathered at the top Jones cried
&#8220;Follow me,&#8221;&mdash;and those whose wind was poor
began to lag. The enemy was driven from this
position, then as we followed him he fired at us
again from behind a stone wall, for there were
plenty here, with others of all kinds. We drove
him again, our laggards helping where they could,
coming up to us as we paused to fire and falling
down to pant. Poor Corder! Part of the charges
he was in, part he had to plod after, out of breath.
A minute&#8217;s rest would freshen him, and then he
would keep up for a while. But the pace was hot,
until suddenly the enemy vanished. In pursuit,
we crossed a wide space with broad flat weatherworn
ledges, then came upon soft ground, and
were bogged.
</p>
<p>The part that confronted our squad was a hog-wallow
below a pig pen and nicely full of water
from the rain. Light-footed David slipped across,
but I, being heavier, plunged in up to my shin.
Then came a barbed wire fence, with the wires
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
so taut that they would not separate to let us
through, nor sag to let us easily over. We were
helping each other, as is the rule, and the sergeant
was hurrying us, as was his duty, when he
was answered back by a corporal&mdash;not of our
platoon, but one who with his squad had become
annexed in the confusion. A little back-talk with
an audience of silent men; our fellows remembered
the new agreement. Then on we went again,
stormed another position, and at last, every
cartridge spent (my head was ringing with the
firing, and rings yet!) we were assembled in the
muddy road.
</p>
<p>A little interview, then while we rested, between
the sergeant, the corporal, and the captain, who
demanded the reason for our platoon&#8217;s delay.
The corporal was explanatory; the captain had to
silence him. Then the captain praised the company.
(He also sent a message to us at Retreat,
where the lieutenant commanded&mdash;we had done
well; he would try to keep us out of brooks hereafter.
I like these laconic statements; they
mean much.) Then I company, with full cartridge
belts, took up the advance-guard work along the
road, and we saw them rummage out of a barn
some cavalrymen who had hidden there. But
soon, the day&#8217;s man&oelig;uvre over, we began the hike
to camp. I wish you could have seen it.
</p>
<p>The rain was over, though it was still cloudy
and the cold wind was strong. The road was a
mass of mud; there was no walking in it. We
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
made two long lines, one on each side of it, and
took up our brisk walk. Mile after mile in every
footing, through desolate country where the
scrub was low, the land slightly rolling, bleak, uninhabited.
The road ran mostly straight; as it
dipped you could see ahead the two lines of men
swiftly plodding on and on.
</p>
<p>There was talk at first, and some jokes. &#8220;That
road looks worse than this,&#8221; said one. &#8220;I wonder
they didn&#8217;t take us down it.&#8221; The bushes looked
very wet. &#8220;How about squad columns through
that brush?&#8221; suggested one. &#8220;Try the prone
position from the middle of the road,&#8221; retorted
another, as we passed a great puddle. A later
puddle, chocolate brown, roused another man&#8217;s
regrets. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to stop and wash my breakfast
kit. I used the water they provided at camp, but
this looks better to me.&#8221; But gradually all talk
died away, and we just drove on and on. There
were questions, of occasional teams that we
passed, as to the distance to Cherubusco. &#8220;Three
miles,&#8221; and again after an hour &#8220;Three miles!&#8221;
Well, it was a long hike, nearly two hours, and I
am glad to say without halt, for in that wind we
should have frozen. But we began to dry off.
At last the sight of the trucks and the cook-tents
cheered us, and we marched onto the ground where
four companies were already finishing their dinner.
We had driven off their enemy, and they had
marched straight through.
</p>
<p>The ground here holds the tent-pins well; the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
tent is secure. But I stood in line for half an hour
in the wind, cold and ever colder in my poncho,
while they let us in driblets into a barn and doled
us out hay at high prices. I felt very cross against
the good woman at whose table I now write, for
not devising a quicker system&mdash;though she suffered
from it too, for her teeth were chattering as
she passed me through. But everything goes by;
even while I shivered the wind dried my clothes;
and I had cold feet for only a couple of hours, by
which time I had dried out a pair of fresh stockings,
and put them on with my dry boots. Since
then I have been comfortably warm. We had
fires, about which we sat; the sun at last came out
(you should have heard the shout at the first thin
rays!) and we have had a wonderful clear orange
sunset, with spruces silhouetted against it, and
the early setting of the young moon. Now it is
clear and cold and quiet outside, with the northern
lights flashing and glowing, violet and white, in
cloud-like masses or shifting spires.
</p>
<p>Well, such was the day, a hard one in many
ways. Says a sergeant sitting by the stove, &#8220;I
can describe it in two words, Damn nasty.&#8221; But
I am no more than ordinarily tired, and am dry.
The hardships of such a day are not to be compared
with those of the poor devils in the trenches
across the water.
</p>
<p>I must close this letter and leave it at the
Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A., for the call to quarters has just
sounded. In fact it is welcome, for I am very
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
sleepy. I am leaving my wet shoes here to dry.
We have just learned, to our sorrow, that we work
tomorrow&mdash;Sunday! But there is one good piece
of news&mdash;our overcoats are coming! Much love
from

</p>
<p>After finishing my letter at the farmhouse last
night, and getting from the good woman my second
pair of dry stockings, I put on everything warm
that I had, and went to bed. Fires were burning
everywhere, with little groups of talking men
around them; but the camp settled down very
quickly. It pleased me to hear the first sergeant
rounding up men to help in unloading the overcoats;
but then I slept, and except for periods
when I woke in the night and as usual told time
by Orion, I slept sound. The men are all declaring
that they slept well, all but one man, who
said he was miserably cold, and looks it. It <i>was</i> a
cold night, with a heavy frost forming even inside
my tent, and ice in my canteen when I tried to
drink from it this morning. But now, warm and
full, I am very comfortable, waiting for the call
at 9.45 to go out and inspect the outposts which
the first battalion are now setting. The captain
has been up and down the street, inquiring how
we are; he stopped to speak to me, feeling, I
think, less constraint with me than he used.
</p>
<p>It was very busy in camp for an hour after
breakfast. Men were cleaning their shoes&mdash;and
some were mourning over them, not having taken
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
warning against leaving them too close to the fire,
when though the leather may not be really burned
it will lose its life and crack. Others were spreading
blankets and clothes to dry, preparing the
short pack (without the roll) for our tour of inspection,
recleaning rifles, shaving, mending their
clothes. Smoke is now drifting from a hundred
fires, and towels and underwear are spread on the
tents or flapping from improvised clothes lines.
But the camp is slowly settling down into quiet,
for work is done, the sun keeps us warm, and
everybody is quite content.
</p>
<p>I have just listened to the story that Newbold,
the corporal of Squad Nine, tells of the fetching of
the overcoats. On arriving at camp yesterday,
wet through, he found that the new shoes which
he bought at the camp exchange in Plattsburg
just before leaving for the hike, were too small,
and asked the captain&#8217;s permission to go to the
village here and try to get another pair. The
captain, after finding out his need, said &#8220;You can
change them in Plattsburg. Be ready in five
minutes to start with the truck.&#8221; So Newbold
found himself in command of a five-ton truck,
wallowing through these roads till they struck
the macadam, forty-five miles in all to Plattsburg.
There he presented his written orders,
started the loading of the truck, and went out
swinging his shoes by the strings till he found a
shop where he could make a swap, the camp exchange
being closed. Forty-five miles over the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
road again, he dozing in a nest he made among
the overcoats, and arriving in time to go to bed
at Taps.
</p>
<p>The overcoats will keep us safe from now on.
But the hard work of the past two days has
knocked out a few more men. Hale, who felt the
cold night so severely, proves to be threatened
with bronchitis, and has been sent in to the hospital.
Hageman, with digestion on strike, has to
leave us for good. I may mention men to you
for the first time, but you must understand that
I have acquaintance with a great many now,
and when in future I hear their cities mentioned,
Kansas City, Cleveland, wherever else, I shall
always remember that I have friends there.
</p>
<p>&mdash;(<i>Afternoon.</i>) We finished the morning with
some genuine outpost work. The first battalion,
going early, set a circle of outposts to the west,
which our battalion, going later, had to find and
relieve. While it was interesting from a military
standpoint, I can scarcely hope to make it
picturesque to you. Supposing an enemy ready
to drop on us, we had to keep out of his sight
while watching for him, and also to ferret out
sentry posts which for the same reason had been
pretty carefully hidden, and to which our directions
were the vaguest. It was all done with
thoroughness and care; we had the usual bogs to
cross and brooks to jump; we found our men in
hollows, thickets, and even in trees; and finally
to our joy (for the day was hot and we were mostly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
sleepy from yesterday) we were brought home,
fed, and allowed to snooze.
</p>
<p>Some of the indefatigables begged for the day
and have gone to Canada, which is but three
miles away. But most of us are content to loll in
camp and rest up, especially considering the fact
that tomorrow we are again to be the advance
guard. This being for the second time in succession,
seems to us something of a compliment,
and H company is proud.
</p>
<p>I hear someone coming and saying, &#8220;Mr. Godwin
is wanted at the head of the street.&#8221; The
lieutenant!
</p>
<p>(<i>Evening.</i>) Yes, it was Lieutenant Pendleton,
of whom, by the way, I have seen very little for
some time. For we go very much by platoons,
as you have noticed; and he having command of
the first is out of my ken. But whenever I have
seen him he is always the same, very cool, inscrutable,
accurate, and busy. His men are devoted
to him. Well, he came walking along,
scrutinizing the groups, and when he found me,
delivering the summons, returning my salute,
and passing on with his little smile. As he did
not come back at all, I see that he took that
method of making his escape.
</p>
<p>For when I got to the head of the street there
was a big touring car, the captain standing talking
beside it, and in it, besides the old Colonel
and our old neighbors the Chapmans, were Vera
and her sister Frances. Some other officers were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
likewise there, and when the visitors descended
to walk about, took charge of them. I, a humble
private lingering near because commanded,
thought that now I might slip away; but Vera
in her usual way chose her own partner, and
chose me.
</p>
<p>The camp did not interest her especially; she
had seen it at a glance from the automobile. The
way we lived was at once familiar to her; I soon
found that she did not want me to explain anything.
Knowing that she always has her own
purposes, and also knowing that I can never
guess them, I waited for her to declare herself.
She selected a convenient seat on a stone wall,
where we could see everything; every man who
went by stared at her in admiration, and evidently
said to himself, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that rookie in luck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Her pretence was that she wanted to know
about me, so as to write you; but pretences with
Vera are very open. Really she wanted to know
about the captain&mdash;what kind of a man, how he
treated us, how we liked him. She couldn&#8217;t quite
bring herself to say, &#8220;Dick, tell me about him!&#8221;
There is always Vera&#8217;s pride. But after all,
there never need be concealments between us;
she knows we are to be friends all our lives. So
she let me see what she wouldn&#8217;t plainly say.
And I answered quite as plainly: a fine captain,
a fine man, the fellows swore by him.
</p>
<p>She objected. &#8220;He says they hate him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you never before,&#8221; I said, &#8220;came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
across an aggressive man who is modest. I know
he thinks that; it merely shows that he can&#8217;t
work for popularity. But he was telling us recently
of the practice hikes he has been giving
his company in Panama, to show that after all
the hardest work is what we shall look back on
with the most pride. It was as plain as day to
us, though not to him, that the men there are
like our fellows here&mdash;they will do anything for
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She dropped the subject; one not knowing Vera
would have supposed that she was not even interested
in it, but I knew that she had learned
what she wanted. Idly she looked down the company
street. &#8220;What are those men doing?&#8221; she
asked.
</p>
<p>A bunch of the men, growing every minute,
had been singing to the tune of Solomon Levi
words that were not clear to us, being too far
away. &#8220;It must be the new company song,&#8221; I
said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been told it&#8217;s good. The fellows are
learning it.&mdash;See, they&#8217;re coming this way. I
believe they mean to sing it to the captain!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Our other visitors were returning, headed by
the captain and Frances. The men, grouped by
the water barrel at the head of the street, waited
till he was near, pushed their leader out in front,
and in hoarse whispers commanded him to begin.
You must understand that Vera promptly, but
without hurry, had got me close enough to listen.
He sang the solo.

<p>The delighted men roared the chorus.

</td></tr></table>

<p>Then, evidently immensely pleased, and laughing
to themselves, the fellows melted away in all
directions.
</p>
<p>As for Vera, she was not daunted by the primitive
simplicity of the words. She looked at the
captain and noted his confusion, looked at me
and made no answer to my question, &#8220;Now don&#8217;t
you see they like him?&#8221; But she gave me a
kindly little push toward Frances, and said, &#8220;Go
and talk with her. I&#8217;ve brought her all this way
to see you.&#8221; And in another moment she had the
captain as her partner, and was making him tell
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
her all the little things she would not listen to
from me.
</p>
<p>It was nice to see Frances. She told me all
about you, and asked about David; and the street
being now very neat with the laundry put away,
and my tent not very far, she walked down and
looked at it, and met every one of the squad, yes,
and knew all about every one in advance, by which
I see that you have read her all my letters. The
boys were greatly struck with her; when our
visitors had gone and I came back to our fire,
Clay in his Southern way paid me the nicest
compliments for her, and Pickle swore that she
was a peach. Then when I thought the subject
was exhausted Knudsen came out of a brown study
with the remark, &#8220;She&#8217;s almost as handsome as
her sister, and besides she&#8217;s the real thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And truly, mother, stunning as Vera is, there&#8217;s
something about Frances&#8217;s eyes and mouth that
is particularly pleasing, don&#8217;t you think?
</p>
<p>There next taking place an Episcopal service
in the open air, I went to it. It was under the
trees near the farmhouse. A rustic cross was
made and set up, there were a few flowers at a
simple altar, and the rail was just a piece of white
birch nailed up between two trees; nothing could
be more appropriate. At least a hundred and
fifty men attended; I couldn&#8217;t ask to hear a
better sermon; and finally, the minister giving
such an invitation to communion as a man of my
free beliefs could accept, I stayed to it. Dusk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
was falling as we came away, and we were called
together for Retreat.
</p>
<p>Troops of the townspeople have visited the
town all day, some looking as if they had come
from a distance. They have gawked all about,
have listened to the band concert, and stood about
and watched our religious service as if it had been
a show. But the best was at Retreat. The band
had finished the Star Spangled Banner, the captain
turned and brought us to attention, then
pivoted about and stood at attention, looking
straight in front of him. A little group of country
folk had pressed up very close, and seeing him
look so fixedly at something, they all swung about
and stared too. Failing to find any unusual object
nailed to the barn which was immediately in
front, they turned back presently, puzzled or reproachful.
When at the end of the bugle call he
turned to dismiss us, the captain could scarcely
maintain his military gravity.
</p>
<p>I finish this at the squad fire, with the fellows
discussing the revival of the rumor concerning
the ball cartridges. They have not been found;
some fool is still toting them about; they are in
A company, B company, and so on down the list.
</p>
<p>Tomorrow we move on again, my cartridge-belt
is full, and I have got everything ready for our
early start. The night is clear and cold&mdash;but we
are hardened to anything now. Love from

</p>
<p>The other companies are cheering in the distance,
and I suppose I know why. For our company
has been spared a great affliction, which
would have been very cruel after a hard morning&#8217;s
work. We came into camp a long hour after
everybody else, and had just pitched our tents
and had dinner when our captain called us together
in a close bunch, and told us that the regimental
commander had been dissatisfied with the
deployments of the other companies, and was
having them out to drill; but that our work had
been satisfactory, and that in consideration of
our hard service on recent days, we were to be
excused. You see we have worked hard on Friday
(digging and defending trenches) Saturday
(when our skirmish work in the mud and wet was
the severest, he said, that a company on the hike
has yet had) and today, when we started first
and finished last. So I imagine that if it was
proposed to include us in this afternoon&#8217;s drill the
captain fought hard to have us excused. I hope
it&#8217;s also true that our skirmish work is good.
We cheered the announcement and enjoyed our
leisure; and now the other companies are expressing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
their delight at being released from their two
hours&#8217; work in a stubble field.
</p>
<p>Last night, after I had mailed my letters, I
stood about and watched the camp with its always
varied picturesqueness&mdash;the many fires, the
drifting smoke lit up by flames, the groups here
and there, the undertones of talk, the singing.
The buzzard song has instantly become popular,
and the lieutenant&#8217;s platoon have a chant of
praise to him&mdash;I don&#8217;t know all the words as yet.

</td></tr></table>

<p>Besides these there have come to us from other
companies, and indeed from earlier camps, other
ditties, not vicious but unquotable, horribly
amusing <i>men&#8217;s</i> songs.
</p>
<p>I gave up watching at last, and made my bed,
which was not so easy as usual, since my poncho,
being old, has taken to stiffening in its folds after
wetting, and when I shook it out, just plain
cracked. Besides, its intimate acquaintance with
barb-wire has resulted in various tears, notably
a long slit and some &#8220;barn-doors.&#8221; So seeing its
usefulness departing, I chiefly made use of my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
blankets and overcoat, in which latter I slept, and
found myself perfectly warm.
</p>
<p>Today we were up earliest, packed in a hurry
(which never, however, allows leaving the ground
untidy) and were off as an advance flank guard
to protect the march of the baggage train and main
body on the straight road here, we going on a
parallel line over whatever country we found.
We marched out of camp, went a mile to the west,
and then turned south&mdash;and a little ripple of joy
went through the company. For it was our first
step toward Plattsburg and <i>home</i>. The men are
all looking forward to the breaking up of camp&mdash;not
that they are feeling any hardship, but that
they are anticipating the set end of things, and
thinking of home life again.
</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s work will not make an interesting
story. We followed our south road till it petered
out, passed through pretty glades and around
attractive knolls, and finally climbed a steep
ascent to where, by a schoolhouse at a corner, we
rested for a while. A platoon was sent north
against a squad of cavalry; the rest went on,
deployed here, deployed there, sent out squads
and recalled them, then lay low in ditches and
watched the movements of some of the enemy
(horsemen and a machine gun) cautiously coming
forward along a crossroad against the corner toward
which we were heading, and which we knew
to be held in strength by our first platoon. They
consulted, came on within range, and then sent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
out a man to reconnoitre. Reaching the corner,
he wheeled and dashed back, waving his hat and
shouting. A burst of fire from the corner pursued
him; and our Squad Seven, crazy to do something,
let off a couple of clips at the men on the machine
gun, who were frantically trying to turn it
about. The cavalry got away, all but their messenger,
who was summoned back. As for the
machine gun, it would not reconcile itself to capture
till, as the captain said, an umpire went out
and picked it by hand.
</p>
<p>We were given another rest, this time by an
odd-looking building which Corder guessed was a
creamery. The fact being established, our boys
were greatly excited, and some filled their canteens
at wholesale prices&mdash;surreptitiously, for the
thing was quite as wrong though not so reckless
as another performance I have seen, the filling
of canteens at wells. If we escape typhoid from
such water it will be because of the inoculation.
</p>
<p>Ordered on again, our platoon was detached
and sent across country to come upon the flank or
rear of any cavalry that might be lurking for us.
We sent out a squad and lost it; then the three
remaining squads went on and on and on, and
grumblings became louder and louder as the men
began to suspect that the leader did not know
where he was going, nor what he was trying to do.
Good David, mindful of our pact, tried in vain to
cheer the boys up; but no, they would grumble,
and (as inexorably follows) made their work the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
harder. It was a long three miles over stiff country,
with a fence, usually barb wire, every hundred
yards&mdash;and bogs! &#8220;What made me sore,&#8221;
says Knudsen at my side at this moment, &#8220;was
that first swamp we came to. It was perfectly
visible, with a good dry meadow on either side to
travel in&mdash;but Jones had to bring us through it.&#8221;
Fence, bog, fence, thicket, fence, small pasture
with an inquisitive bull (we went across smartly!)
fence, rough climb over rocks: such was the order
of our going, till at last we heard the captain&#8217;s
distant whistle, and found the remainder of the
company resting comfortably by the roadside
waiting for us. But there was no soft place for
the second platoon, for on we went at once, two
miles more to camp, where the other companies
had long since pitched their tents, had fed themselves,
and now were streaming out toward town
to fill in the chinks in their stomachs. The best
ice cream, I am told, is at the millinery store.
</p>
<p>For the first time since Friday I was able today
to get a swim&mdash;or rather a dip in an ice-cold
stream, below a broken dam. Picturesque, so
many men&#8217;s naked bodies, undressing, bathing,
dressing, with the rushing stream, the rocky
bank, the overhanging trees. Then I cut my toe
and had to have it dressed at the doctor&#8217;s tent,
where I had a glimpse at another side of camp
life.
</p>
<p>I met one of our fellows coming away grumbling.
&#8220;My blisters were dressed by an artilleryman who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
disgusted me with his profanity, and who put the
plaster on the wrong spot.&#8221; But I was tended,
having a more important wound, by one of the
doctors. And after my experience I can declare
that all doctors are divided into three kinds.
</p>
<p>One was a volunteer, one of our own company,
by the way, whose feet having given out was
transferred to the medical corps, and keeps an
especially kindly eye on all H company men.
But he being busy, I fell into the hands of the
regulars, and had a chance to judge of the opinion
common among the rookies&mdash;&#8220;they treat you
like a horse.&#8221; Now regular officers must be short
and sharp with their men, and the doctors among
them are taught to be suspicious by the sojering
they necessarily detect. It must be a struggle to
keep sweet the milk of human kindness.
</p>
<p>The man who dressed my foot had succeeded
in remembering that the majority of men were
neither cowards nor dishonest. He was considerate
of me and of the orderlies under him. But
alongside was a scowl. A poor fat bandsman
with a lame foot was not excused from marching
the next day. The orderly who had mislaid
the iodine was scalped. The orderly who had
charge of the medicine chest was also scalped.
The man whose foot this doctor was dressing was
so certainly a man of character and a person of
civilian consequence that he was not scalped for
presuming to turn his ankle; but I felt the certainty
that under actual campaign conditions he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
would have fared no better than the others. It
was borne in upon me that a gentleman who is
gentlemanly only to gentlemen is not a gentleman
at all.
</p>
<p>Though I have not spoken much of them, we
have our daily conferences whenever the weather
will permit. Today we first had battalion conference,
when Major Goring spoke of recent
man&oelig;uvres&mdash;and we men were interested to see
that even he spoke of Friday as an extremely
successful day, and Saturday as an unusually
hard one. Then supper, then bed-making (which
is desirable before the light goes&mdash;by the way, I
am writing no longer in the afternoon but the
evening) then regimental conference, when Major
Downes spoke against time for an hour (and
mighty well, upon the Philippines and army experiences
there) in the hope that General Wood
would come, which he didn&#8217;t. Now I am writing
while sitting upon a firkin of apples that I had
sent from our neighbor Williams, waiting for the
squad to come and help me eat them. Very bad
writing this, I know, by the light of the fire, holding
the paper first folded, then bent, then skewed,
anything to stiffen it and catch the light, while
every moment I must shift it as I move my hand
along the line.
</p>
<p>The boys are gathering for a feed&mdash;the apples,
Some honey, bread, shredded wheat, cream from
the local creamery (Knudsen&#8217;s inspiration), the
first such feast since the hike began. We have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
invited our neighbors, Squad Nine. So, since
there is no more to tell, I will close this.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pass up your cups,&#8221; says Clay.

<p>Love to you from

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>I write on my back in the usual roadside ditch,
our column having halted after firing has broken
out in our rear. My pack was on wrong this
morning, hanging too low, so that the straps cut
me; I was glad to stop, so as to adjust it. Usually
it is no trouble: in fact in some of the skirmishes
I have not thought of it at all except to remark
how little it cumbered me.
</p>
<p>But the pack can be, I have found, a detriment
in case of a fall. Yesterday, going through a
boggy wood, with rocks and slimy fallen trees, I
slipped and plunged forward. Without the pack
I could have saved myself; but the heavy roll,
shooting ahead, was just enough to overbalance
me and bring me down among the stumps and
boulders. To protect my face I twisted as I fell.
This brought the pack under me, my head was
lower than my hips, the pack wedged in a hole,
and I should have had difficulty in rising had
not the boys yanked me up.
</p>
<p>Our feed at bed time was a success. We were
warned of a hard day to follow, the march being
extra long, and the road being so unsafe for
trucks (on account of weak culverts) that we must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
carry our own dinners, which we must eat cold.
In consequence we were given this morning an
emergency ration, consisting of a slice of Bologna
sausage, two pieces of dry bread, and two hard
boiled eggs. These we put in our meat cans, with
such chocolate as we could get from the buzzards;
we are carrying them now, and are wondering if
the cooks will get to camp in time to give us coffee.
</p>
<p>Behind me, after quiet, the fire has broken out
again. The boys listen critically. &#8220;We shan&#8217;t
have to go back for that.&#8221; There is a whole
battalion behind us that can stand off any attack.
</p>
<p>(<i>Later.</i>) The hike today has been steady plodding,
halting at the regular intervals, also at times
of attack from the rear. At first the boys sang a
good deal, new songs and old. But the last two
stretches, though we have had continual jokes
and laughter, have been a persistent grind. For
the first time we have had climbing, pretty steady
from our start to the height of land, a rise of 502
feet, after which we stumbled down a very stony
track till we reached a better road at Halfway
House, an uninviting structure between two unknown
terminals. We had one fine look-off at
the highest point, over a gently descending slope
of miles to a strip of Champlain, and beyond,
floating above the haze, the Green Mountains of
Vermont. Now we are resting again, the boys
talking, smoking, studying the map, and singing
quietly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<div class='ra' style=' font-style:italic;'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>In camp at Ledger Corners.</p>
<p style='text-align: right; '>At the mouth of my kennel.</p>
</div>

<p>The day&#8217;s hike, ten or twelve miles, is finished,
a very dreary performance indeed. The way was
very dull; and though the boys were at first inclined
to say they were glad not to be on skirmish
duty, we having worked so hard of late, before
the trudge was over we were all tired of the
monotony, and would have been glad of a brush.
And we got just as tired and hungry as if we had
had an extra four or five miles of cross-country
work. At last after passing through a district
whose only beauties were its few high views and
the gorgeous colors of its maples, and whose general
sparseness of people, unattractive fields, and
ill-kept houses (chiefly of plastered logs) became
after a while depressing, we came to almost the
only smooth field that we had seen. The first of
the trucks, after its journey of thirty-six miles,
was just arriving; nevertheless it was not long
after we had pitched camp that coffee was ready,
with which we wetted our dry snack. You should
watch us veterans pitch camp. Every tent is
erected in fifteen minutes at most, less if rain is
threatening. I always hurry off early for the hay,
leaving Bann to finish pegging down, and to ditch
if necessary. My haste saves delay; today I got
into the hay-barn just before a quartermaster
came and formed a line. I always lug away a
full poncho; though the hay almost fills the tent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
at first it soon packs down, and I want this amount
to make sleep easy, and to make sure that even
if rain gets under the tent, we shall sleep on an
island in comfort. Tonight the weather promises
to be fine, so that Bann did no digging except
for sods to lay on the edges of the tent to
keep out the wind.
</p>
<p>Afternoons are always pretty full. We are
said to have our time to ourselves&mdash;yes, and if
conference on the man&oelig;uvres is omitted (as
today, when our battalion had no man&oelig;uvres to
confer about), it really amounts to something.
And I have gained time by toughening myself,
the rest I used to crave at Plattsburg and on the
range no longer being necessary. But I love to
linger over the luxury of the swim&mdash;or rather the
bath&mdash;if there is an accessible stream. There was
none at Cherubusco, and to tell the truth I didn&#8217;t
miss it, so weary was I, and the weather so cold.
But yesterday and today I enjoyed the chance to
soap myself and souse. Next if there is mail (and
I can always depend on my letter from you) I
like to enjoy it and skim the newspaper. After
that the rifle should be cleaned, even on such a
day as this when I did not fire a shot, for the
barrel has a habit of &#8220;sweating&#8221; which requires
it to be cleaned out and oiled. And then hundreds
of us fall to on our letters home, always in
a public place, with talk going on all about, and
with men going by who pause and interrupt.
</p>
<p>For in our company, and I doubt not in all the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
others, there is the friendliest feeling for each
other, and for each other&#8217;s fortunes. We know
that So-and-so has had a sprain, that such a man
is in trouble with his digestion, that Hill has a
fallen arch, and that Homans has terribly blistered
his feet and is these days riding on the trucks,
poor devil. Those who have met at the hospital
tent have a common interest. Thus getting acquainted,
we hail each other when we meet in the
street, stop at each other&#8217;s fires, compare notes,
congratulate on recovery, sympathize. There are,
too, the recognized jokers, men who are always
looking out for a chance to make a hit. And
finally camp news is handed along from man to
man.
</p>
<p>With all this going on, afternoon and evening,
a fellow is continually interested and, you may
say, busy. There is good feeling almost everywhere,
though it is interesting to see how the
degree of it varies.
</p>
<p>You see this particularly in the solidarity of
squads. There is somewhere in the regiment, I
am told, a squad that does nothing but squabble;
the men have nearly all in turn been corporal,
and no one will obey. But mostly there is bound
to spring up a feeling of unity, as the eight men
sleep and march and man&oelig;uvre together. This
will differ according to the men&#8217;s natural sociability
or feeling of loyalty, with perhaps jealousy
in one man, or officiousness in another. Occasionally
you will find a squad whose masterful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
corporal interferes too much with his men&#8217;s personal
freedom&mdash;and that has to be adjusted by a
little plain language. Sometimes a fellow is discontented
with his squad; Randall, for example,
doesn&#8217;t feel himself appreciated by his mates, and
seeks chums elsewhere. But none of his new intimates
stay by him very long.
</p>
<p>Our squad holds together very well; we eat together
when our tents are not too long a journey
from the mess tent, a matter of consequence with
a brimming dish, and in general we have a constant
eye out for each other&#8217;s movements. But
more than this, we are taking Squad Nine into a
little confederation; they are men of the most
diverse sorts but very much of a unit, and all
bright, witty, and ready to cooperate. Indeed,
having a system of fetching each other&#8217;s hay and
filling each other&#8217;s canteens, they have a better
squad organization than we. It has pleased me
very much that our banter between the tents at
Plattsburg has turned into the friendliest of feeling,
so that we naturally seek each other out.
We gave them a spread last night, and today are
invited to another in return.
</p>
<p>The column on the march is an amusing thing.
Taken in little, I have got very familiar with the
backs and legs of the four in front, Bann&#8217;s springy
tread, Clay&#8217;s sturdy tramp, the little stiffness that
shows in ancient Corder&#8217;s gait, and the untiring
litheness of Knudsen&#8217;s swing. Beside me Reardon
trudges silently, his hat always flopped a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
little over his eyes, his head up. Sometimes I
make him talk, and have pried out of him much
of his family history. Beyond him Pickle goes on
springs, cracking jokes like a little internal combustion
engine. And David, now very tanned
and wide awake, finishes our four. Without looking,
we know the voice of each of our neighbors
behind or in front, even so far as the witless
stutterer some squads ahead, or the flat-voiced
constant querist somewhere behind. But now
when he raises his song his neighbors shut him
up.
</p>
<p>Our company in column always remembers
who commands it. The first song we begin to
sing, and the last we give up, is the Buzzard song,
to show our loyalty. Incidentally the song has
improved discipline, for yesterday when a buzzard
approached us with the inevitable chocolate,
tobacco, and matches, we passed him along down
the line with the chorus, &#8220;Poor old buzzard, get
away out of here,&#8221; though, to be frank, the wording
is somewhat stronger. No buzzard will ever
get anything out of our company again when on
the road, even though we may be at rest. Other
little touches show our memory of the captain&#8217;s
injunctions. We have a sergeant who in former
camps was demoralized by drilling under other
officers, and who at times crosses his gun upon
his shoulders as he marches. Then the whole
column shouts at him till he takes it down. And
when some other company passes us, with men
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
carrying the guns by the straps, we shout:
&#8220;Porter! Suit-case men! Red-caps!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It is fine to march in a column of men and
know the current of energy that flows along it.
However many miles you have marched, however
tired your feet and back and arms may be, in the
knowledge that you are one of a disciplined regiment
there is something that strengthens you and
keeps you going. For in one sense Route Step,
when you may go as you please, is a fiction; we
must still keep so close together that to preserve
the step and the cadence is almost a necessity,
and though we carry our pieces at ease, we still
swing along together. And as you look along
rising ground, and see the hundreds of men ahead,
and know there are as many more behind, all
going, going, the knowledge that you are a part
of that machine, and that to fall out would be to
mar it and to cut yourself off from it, keeps you
still moving on your weary pins.
</p>
<p>You see I am speaking of general things, because
of particular events today there is nothing
to describe. The bathing today was most shockingly
public, on both sides of the bridge in this
apology for a town. Whenever wheels were heard,
men shouted &#8220;Cover!&#8221; and those in the water
(which was very shallow) would try to get under.
But I think the women folk had been warned to
keep away, since none of them crossed, at least
while I was there.
</p>
<p>(<i>Evening.</i>) Tonight we have had a talk from
General Wood. I have not reported our conferences
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
to you, they are so incidental, and indeed so
theoretical at times. But we have had a captain
from the border tell us of the coming of the green
militia there at the mobilizing of the national
guard, of their first helplessness under service conditions,
full as every company was of new men.
The work of getting this half- or quarter-trained
mass ready for fighting was enormously more
difficult than our Plattsburg work; and the fact
that these regiments, if sent into the field at first,
would have been helpless against the Mexicans,
needs no explanation (disagreeable as the idea is)
to every recruit here. We have at another conference
been shown the detail work of supplying
our camps both at the training ground and on
the hike, and the immense importance of the
work of the obscure quartermaster&#8217;s department.
Talk after talk has impressed us with the amount
of work needed to drill, to equip, to work into
fighting shape, even a few thousand men; and
there is no Plattsburg rookie who does not fully
understand, and will not in detail explain to his
neighbors when he goes home, the absurdity of
Mr. Bryan&#8217;s army of a million men which is to
spring into being at the call of the President. It
would very much relieve us to be assured that
the government is ready to equip them even in
the least particular.
</p>
<p>General Wood has talked to us from time to
time. Back at the training camp he told us somewhat
of our military history. You know our
text-books feed us up on our military glories;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
but looked at through the cold eyes of the statistician
we know now that these were achieved at
the cost of enormous and unnecessary losses, all
from lack of system and readiness. Moreover
there are certain military disgraces which need
to be called to our attention, to make us resolve
that these things shall not happen again. Considering
further that we have never yet had a
war with a first class military power (with two
at least of whom we are in controversy now) and
remembering that not only has our national guard
proved a failure at this crisis, but that the new
enlistments in the regular army have not come
to pass, so that it is many thousands below its
paper strength, we are now at the point of asking
ourselves what we are to do to meet the military
necessity which will some day suddenly come
upon us. We believe it is coming; no soldier will
deny it or can more than hope against it. Therefore
we must prepare&mdash;but how?
</p>
<p>&mdash;It is time for our spread; Squad Nine has
come not merely with camp delicacies, but with
cakes and candies from home! So I will break off
this gloomy epistle with, as usual, love from
</p>

<p><i>P. S.</i> Still come the variations of the story of
the clip of ball cartridges. Someone knows somebody
else who found it among his cartridges one
morning and slipped it into another man&#8217;s belt.
Thus the clip, and the story, travels.

</p>
<p>We were up today as usual at half past five,
those who were lucky rising a little earlier for
more comfortable dressing. And yet, after all,
ten minutes is enough for those few observances
which may be dignified with the name of our
toilet. The pint and a half in the canteens allows
us a scrub of the teeth, and a rinsing of the
face and hands&mdash;no more, especially if we are
to have anything to drink on the day&#8217;s march,
for the morning, with an empty water-butt, is no
time to replenish the supply. Pickle, having a
budding mustache, carries a pocket mirror and
comb, and so can arrange his hair; but the rest
are usually satisfied with a hasty smoothing with
the hands&mdash;and since the hat goes on at once and
stays on, why not? Because of the cold, all
sleep in their stockings, which saves morning
time, besides preventing bother in the lacing of
the trousers. (It is at night and at the swim that
stockings are changed.) Thus in the morning
only the shoes and the leggings must go on; we
are already in our sweaters, and so are soon prepared
for the first formation. The cartridge-belt
and rifle are dragged out from the straw and laid
ready in case they are called for; then one can
proceed with packing the squad-bag, and with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
striking the tent and separating the shelter-halves.
Old Bann is a wise one; he always begins by securing
his five tent-pins, and so leaves to me the
responsibility of rummaging out the remaining
five, of which one always dodges me for a while.
</p>
<p>The second call sounds, to be followed by the
first sergeant&#8217;s whistle. &#8220;Corporals, get your
men out! Belts and rifles!&#8221; There is snatching
up and buckling, then there is scientific delay over
packing, with eye and ear to the exhortations of
sergeants and squad leaders; but at last even the
slowest are on their way to the head of the street
to take their places. The corporals are calling
the numbers of their squads, &#8220;Six!&#8221; &#8220;Nine!&#8221;
&#8220;Twelve!&#8221; and with anxious eyes are watching
for their belated men. The line forms: there
is a gap here for a smoking fire, and other gaps
that mean absentees. Rear-rank men step forward
to fill the places of their file-leaders, and as
the assembly sounds the front-rank men are glad
to slip, unobserved, into the vacant spaces in the
rear. &#8220;Report!&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;First squad, present.&#8221; &#8220;Second
squad, private Smith absent.&#8221; Smith, hurrying
up, curses under his breath. &#8220;Police duty
today,&#8221; he knows, and makes a grimace at private
Brown, who has found his place in the fourth
squad just in time.
</p>
<p>Once the reports are in, the first sergeant orders
&#8220;Inspection&mdash;Harms!&#8221; With a rattle the
guns are tossed up and opened; with another
rattle, at the next command, they are closed and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
snapped. The sergeant salutes the waiting lieutenant,
whose commonest proceeding, now on the
hike, is to warn us of an early start. Then perhaps
he orders &#8220;Stack arms!&#8221; and we grumble.
A nuisance to have, in the company street, a
line of stacks through which we may not pass.
Then, dismissed, we return to our packing, always
with an eye to the forming of a line at the
cook tent. For no one wants to be late in that
line, yet all wish to get forward with the packing.
There is, on these cold mornings, another consideration:
it is pleasantest to eat breakfast in
sweaters, which we know must be discarded for
the march. If the officers or sergeants come with
&#8220;Hurry up those blanket-rolls!&#8221; off the sweaters
must come, and the rolls are made. Otherwise,
at the mess-call utensils are snatched up, and the
men hurry to the head of the company street, to
form the double line, and to be glad of the extra
comfort that the sweaters give.
</p>
<p>The meal disposed of and the meat-cans washed
(or rather rinsed) the remaining packing is quickly
finished. The rolls are made, the squad-bags are
stuffed full, and both are carried to the trucks.
The packs are made, and the belts, heavy with the
fresh ammunition that has just been handed out,
are hooked to them. A swing, a boost, a hitch
or two, and our pappooses, our constant companions,
are with us till we make camp, seven
hours or more later. Then the whole company
street is policed, and the hay piled in big cocks on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
which, in the early sun, the men loll during the
last few minutes before the bugle calls.
</p>
<p>Our second battalion was first in ranks this
morning, drawn close together to hear the words
of the major. There was to be, he presumed, a
rencounter, or meeting engagement; he merely
had sealed orders, to be opened at a certain spot
on the route. Our battalion was to start first;
he advised all officers to study the terrain as we
passed along. And then we were off, while the
first battalion was decorating its hats with white,
and jeering at us as future enemies.
</p>
<p>The trucks were a mile ahead of us; we saw the
dotted line of their khaki tops marking the road
that led out of the high basin in which lay the
camp. As we too climbed the steady slope to the
southeast we were willing to leave the dreariness
of its unkept farms and get among the woods.
Lyon Mountain, on the west, slowly drew its
colored bulk behind the shoulder of a nearer hill
while we came closer and closer among the maples.
The shallow notch over which we passed was high
and open; nothing overhung us, but the tawny
tapestry of the woods ran up gentle slopes to the
right and left, and the few evidences of farming,
save for the all-present wire fences, faded quite
away. The slope grew stiffer, but there was no
slackening of pace. Heads bent low, chests began
to labor, and the sweat rolled down. A welcome
rest relieved us; then up we started and
went on again, at each change of grade looking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
for the downward turn, and each time disappointed
till&mdash;ah, there was a corner, and on the
slope beyond we saw the column descending amid
dust. Then we too turned the corner, and faced
the view.
</p>
<p>It was not wide, for the woods by the roadside
(brilliant in the sun on the right, subdued in the,
shade on the left) limited it to a V. Below was
the valley, and beyond and above it, piling ridge
on ridge, rose the hills, climbing to the shaded
blue peak that loomed in the very middle. It
was a picture, striking and complete.
</p>
<p>In vain I looked for the lake, which in all our
earlier landscapes showed between us and the
hills. Then a reference to the sun showed that I
was still looking in a southerly direction. Further,
this great hill, so high and clear, was both taller
and nearer than the Green Mountains could be.
Someone behind me said &#8220;Whiteface,&#8221; and I knew
that I was looking straight toward the heart of the
Adirondacks.
</p>
<p>Again we made a turn, and the view broadened
out. To the east the whole landscape sloped toward
the sun, against whose rays the brilliance
of the woods faded, though still amid the green
one could see, to north or to south, the yellow,
the orange, or the dotted scarlet of the flaming
maples. The easterly view was less distinct; in
the distant blue the hills flattened to a fairly low
horizon.
</p>
<p>But while, still marching, I idly gazed, my eye
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
was caught by an odd trick of the sun which, now
at nine o&#8217;clock well on its upward way, yet seemed
to illuminate the bottom of a cloud that hung
near the sky line. It was a sunset effect impossible
by day, but there was the distinctly gleaming
band. And then I knew&mdash;Champlain! It was
the lake, turning faintly silver further north or
further south. What I had thought to be a cloud
was distant haze. And above it hung, at first
unnoticed, the faint blue silhouettes of Mansfield
and its neighbor peaks.
</p>
<p>As we marched down the slope my neighbors,
mindful of what was to come, said &#8220;Gee! Suppose
we are to climb up this again?&#8221; But apprehension
was soon lost in the interest of the
town we now entered, whose great buildings (in
which each squad threatened to leave its most
obstreperous member) had been visible for some
distance. Dannemora seems to be a town whose
prosperity, in this out of the way place, depends
solely upon the great prison that stands in its
midst. We marched along beneath the huge
wall that forms one side of the main street; it
rose in places fifteen feet above our heads. Dust!
dust! A school was let out; its scholars came
streaming uphill to watch us, and to tag along
beside us even after we had turned away from
the great hospital of the prison, and were once
more amid farms. Other school children were
waiting for us along the road. We saw very little
of the buzzard in this population; they handed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
or threw us apples, and the boys even undertook
to fill canteens&mdash;the same old trick which the
officers failed to detect.
</p>
<p>Still we tramped on amid the dust which rose
around us; if Saturday&#8217;s was the wet hike, this was
the dusty one. As we neared a crossroad we were
given the command &#8220;Attention!&#8221; So we came
to the right shoulder and straightened our ranks,
that we might look better as we passed the General.
Another quarter mile (we were an hour
beyond Dannemora now) and the familiar motorcyclist,
our messenger in so many skirmishes,
darted by us to reach the captain. We grunted.
And then &#8220;Squads left&mdash;march, company&mdash;halt!&#8221;
We found ourselves facing the wall of bushes.
&#8220;Prepare to load!&#8221; Who, we wondered, would
accidentally fire now? Ah, the distant pop was
from the next company, and we heard its men
angrily jeering their clumsy mate.
</p>
<p>Squads-left again, and now we were starting
back on the way that we had come. Uphill of
course, but we feared that worse was to follow,
as we remembered the ridge that we passed some
little distance back, and recalled the advantages
it offered for defence. To be sure, J Company
was now nearest it and should secure it, if the enemy
were not too close. But a burst of shooting,
not very far away, apprised us that they were
already at hand. And then came the expected
order, &#8220;Double time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The pace in double time, say the regulations,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
is thirty-six inches long; the cadence is at the
rate of one hundred and eighty steps a minute.
It is not a run. I have heard the captain call
back a lieutenant and his platoon: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t say
Run; I said Double time!&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;An easy run,&#8221;
says the little blue book. An easy run! With
eighteen pounds on the back, and eight around the
waist, and another nine in the hand&mdash;an easy
run! Oh, in that dust, and up that slope, it was
pound, pound, pound, till my heart thumped like
the engine of a little Ford at high gear on a stiff
grade, and my knees (how well the ancients knew
the importance of those joints!) were like lead.
The breath was failing, failing&mdash;till at last in a
burst of relief I got my second wind. But poor
Corder! Three times, as I watched him laboring
in front of me, he flagged. Three times he
visibly mustered his powers and pounded on.
The fourth time he was spent. He had already
stepped out of the column, to let us pass him,
when I heard the welcome whistle. &#8220;Halt!&#8221;
Corder had strength to take his place again, we
were hustled into the ditch for cover, and I found
a grateful position on the ground. There was no
talk; everyone was too busy with a shortness of
breath.
</p>
<p>The firing in our front was now more systematic,
and was spreading to the left. It was not long
before we were ordered to the right of the road,
and marching in the ditch, went forward. Then
double time again, for a short distance, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
line swung out into the road as it turned to the
right into a field. Suddenly there was the major,
ordering us back into the ditch, and his eye met
mine in the midst of one of his remonstrances.
&#8220;The road is always unsafe!&#8221; Look to yourself,
major, I thought, as obediently I ducked aside and
left him in the position of danger. A ploughed
field brought us to a walk; we climbed a stiff ascent,
then found ourselves facing a nasty bit of
thick wood, through which we were ordered in
squad columns. Down a slope and across a gully
and up again; then we went through more open
country, but still among trees. Finally we aligned
ourselves behind the top of a little rise, where we
might comfortably sit or kneel, having plenty of
cover behind logs or stones. The enemy that tried
to cross the ravine below us would have a surprise.
</p>
<p>There followed all the confusion of an attack
in the woods. We heard the enemy coming, saw
at length the white hat-bands, opened fire, and
heard his heavy answer. The firing slackened
on our front, strengthened on our right, and our
platoon was again detached, to take care of this
new danger. As we waited at the edge of a wood,
while the major held us for orders, a half-grown
robin, with speckled breast, nervously flew about us
as if he wished to take refuge from the noises that
distracted him. Into the underbrush we plunged
again, were posted here, and fired; were sent there,
and fired again; were hurried at the double to
the flank, where I, coming behind the rest, was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
held by the captain and posted with a rear-guard,
to fire upon the enemy if he appeared across
a little clearing. It was evident that the enemy&#8217;s
intentions could not be guessed in advance. I
heard very rapid firing at my back, and a burst
of cheering. Then the bugle blew, and the
whistles sounded everywhere through the wood.
Of the enemy I had had few glimpses, and in
general I realized that the confusion had been
extreme.
</p>
<p>As I plodded through underbrush to rejoin my
company, I came across some white-banded fellows
who, with fixed bayonets and heavy breathing,
had evidently just been charging. Meeting
presently a member of our company, I asked him
what had taken place in this part of the encounter.
&#8220;Oh, those fellows? You never saw anything so
foolish. They wandered out from the woods and
fixed bayonets in the open, and we fired at them
for five minutes, at a hundred and fifty yards,
before they began their charge. Of course they
stopped at fifty yards from us, the rule, you know.
Then our lieutenant asked theirs what his men
wore to make them bullet-proof, and we hoped
there would be some back talk, for the other
fellow was mad. Pendleton&#8217;s tongue does cut.
But an umpire came and ruled them out, and we&#8217;re
sure of them, anyway.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Well, fighting in the woods is &#8220;impossible,&#8221; as
the major explained to us later at conference.
Apparently if it must be, it must, but there can
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
be very little science in it. At the conference our
officers explained what had happened at different
parts of our line, and we were all sure that we had
won. But I noticed that the two battalions held
their conferences separately, and concluded that
the same consoling deduction was being made at
the other discussion. Yet one idea must have
fixed itself in the mind of every thinking man
there: we were too green, and some of our platoon-leaders
were too green, for effective work under
such circumstances. Once or twice on our skirmishes
we have known that we did well, and
after the wet fight toward Cherubusco our captain
ventured the statement that he could make
us soldiers in six months; but today I think he
would have doubled the period, for it was plain
that a veteran enemy determined to push his
lines forward would have made short work of us
in our confusion.
</p>
<p>One thing I learned which I shall remember to
my private advantage. The next time I find myself
firing from behind a snake fence I shall not
crowd forward into one of the corners. For that
brings one&#8217;s ears even with the muzzles of the
rifles to the right and left, and the result is deafening.
</p>
<p>We had delighted the foot-loose population of
Dannemora, and perhaps had tantalized the poor
fellows behind the bars; certainly we gave profitable
employment to a score of professional buzzards,
who turned up with their bags to search
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
the woods where we had been firing. As for ourselves,
we were soon on the road again and hiking
in the dust, through country which was still too
deserted and unkempt, with its brush pastures
and scattered log houses, for the taste of a New
Englander. At dips and turns of the road we
saw the drab column winding before us; we passed
through straggling Cadyville and came at last to
the unwelcome macadam. Our feet, used to the
gravel roads, found this unyielding surface tire
us more in a mile than the other could do in five.
I admit that I was thoroughly glad when at last
we saw the camping ground, turned aside into
the green grass, and pitched our tents. Some
strap of the pack having slipped, the weight had
irked me more in the last hour than it had done
in all the nine days of the hike, and it was
with great relief that I swung it from my shoulders.
</p>
<p>Another proof of the mathematical formula
that Food Indulgence equals Indigestion. A gormandizer
from a neighboring squad has lately
been very savage on account of dyspepsia. Yesterday
he crawled out of bed with the sourest
expression and would scarcely respond to greetings,
spoke of his stomach, and intimated that
he would ask to ride with the baggage. Yet he
marched with us, preserving so gloomy a silence
that Corder, experimenting, hailed him four times
before he would answer. Then he vouchsafed,
&#8220;Every step I take my stomach hurts me,&#8221; and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
so he stalked on, alone amid the jollity of the
marching column. We had reached camp, and
were pitching tents, when I heard his bunkie demanding
his whereabouts. He had disappeared,
leaving his mate to do his work. But before
long I heard his voice, entirely bright and happy,
say &#8220;Sixty cents!&#8221; and there he stood in the
midst of his squad, triumphantly holding up a
big mince pie.
</p>
<p>Today the poor man was down again, wrapped
in gloom. Again he threatened to ask to ride,
but again he managed to subdue his pains. Said
I, &#8220;I suppose that pie is paying you back.&#8221; He
answered, &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand. I have to
buy those things because they give us so little
sweet in our diet.&#8221; One has to respect misery,
however caused, and I bothered him no more.
</p>
<p>But David has managed to subdue Pickle, who
goes no longer to the buzzards&#8217; counters, and
though he complains that the struggle is hard, he
admits that the results pay. No more pains for
him. So yesterday, though at the sight of the
crisp pie Pickle&#8217;s eye wandered toward the pastry
booth outside the gate, when he caught David&#8217;s
warning glance he controlled himself and went on
with his work.
</p>
<p>It was here at Cadyville that, for the first time
since leaving Plattsburg, we were able to have a
real swim, or rather (since the water was like
ice) we found depth enough and room enough for
all. Over a meadow and down a bluff a path
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
led from camp to a big paper mill which stood
above a gorge of the Saranac River. The huge
pile of pulp, at which men were picking and prying
with pickaxe and canthook, ought to be a
gold mine in these days of high prices of paper.
Beyond was the dam, higher than a house on its
clear side and (so we were told) of equal depth
on the other. Along the sides of the big basin
there was room for the whole regiment; and the
dive from the dam&mdash;how the men yelled when
their heads came out, and how they swam to get
ashore again!
</p>
<p>Our last afternoon in camp! We felt that we
had earned repose after a day&#8217;s hard work&mdash;a
month&#8217;s hard work! No more skirmishing among
rocks, stumps, and barbed wire; no more firing
of the gun, and no more cleaning of it. As we
wished to hand the guns back in good condition,
and as most of our patches and oil had given out,
many of us took the friendly offers of the regulars
(cavalrymen, bandsmen, cooks) who did the best
business, working in pairs, that they had yet
done. Even David relaxed the severity of his
self-discipline, and handed out his gun and his
quarter-dollar. We lolled, we talked thoughtfully,
we already regretted. Men exchanged addresses,
and made appointments for the distant
future. I noticed that the squad kept pretty
close together, as if knowing that soon it must
separate for good. And now, rather seriously,
the men are getting ready for the last Retreat.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>(<i>Evening.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>We have had our final conference, in a little
amphitheatre at one side of the camp. As the
dusk fell the General talked to us for the last
time. He took up the subject of preparedness
where he left it yesterday&mdash;what are we to do to
face an emergency, all our present methods failing,
the emergency, if it comes, sure to be so
frightful? The old volunteer system has broken
down in each of our wars&mdash;the Revolutionary,
the war of 1812, the Mexican, the Civil. We have
seen it, before our eyes, break down in England
now. The volunteer system is unfair&mdash;why
should one man fight for another equally fit? It
is therefore undemocratic. There is only one
thing left, universal training for all young men,
and conscription in war of all of military age.
</p>
<p>Two years ago I should have recoiled from this;
a year ago I should have shaken my head doubtfully.
Today I see with relief that there is this
system to save us at need. It will save us whether
there is war or, as we all hope, peace. You know
how I have worried over our national future with
this immense immigration, which yearly is less
assimilated. The one thing which will teach the
young immigrant American ideals and loyalty to
his new flag, is service with all other young men
for the same great purpose. How can they stand
nightly at Retreat before the flag, hear the &#8220;Star
Spangled Banner&#8221; played, salute the last sight of
the colors&mdash;how can they do this for but a single
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
month and not feel pledged forever to defend the
old flag? I tell you, mother, when I realized tonight
that this was our last Retreat something
gripped my throat and brought the water to my
eyes. Nor was I the only one, to judge from
what I saw about me.
</p>
<p>So when the General asked us, as I suppose he
has asked previous regiments, to vote in favor of
universal training, every man of us shouted Ay!
</p>
<p>I have asked some of the squad if they mean
to come again next year, in case the universal
training movement does not put the training
camps out of business. The answer is Yes, if
they can get away again. Knudsen means to be
in the cavalry; he would have gone with them
this year if the regulations had not required first
a period with the infantry. David I have not
asked yet; but Corder will come back in spite of
his years. &#8220;But I must go with the quartermaster&#8217;s
department,&#8221; he said; and when I asked
why: &#8220;It&#8217;s plain enough that if I can&#8217;t keep up in
a charge I ought to go where I can be of real use.
Now nothing is more important than the Q. M.
department, and trained men are needed there as
well as anywhere else. So that&#8217;s my job in the
next camp.&#8221; It&#8217;s plain he&#8217;d rather march in the
ranks, but he will change rather than leave the
preparedness movement to get along without him.
</p>
<p>During the afternoon there had been piled
truckload after truckload of cordwood at the end
of the company streets. As the conference broke
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
up someone lighted the heap, and soon the flames,
before the wind, were leaping forty feet in the
air. I took your latest letter from my pocket
and could clearly read it, though at a hundred
and fifty yards&#8217; distance. With shouts the crowd
hastened to the fire, and company after company,
each in a long line of men cheering for their officers,
took its turn in a snake-dance around the
blaze. As the bonfire dwindled to an immense
heap of glowing coals, a deep semi-circle gathered,
sitting above it on the hill, sang the songs of the
hike, and called for solos from favorite singers.
Chums walked up and down near the fire, or in
the further darkness lay in front of tents and
talked plans. Little groups gathered here or
there, then restlessly broke up and shifted as men
sought acquaintances for a last word that might
be impossible tomorrow. In this shifting kaleidoscope
of men I was glad to find Hale, cured of
his bronchitis, and with a tale of how at the hospital
they locked up the men&#8217;s clothes, as the only
way of preventing them from escaping too soon
and rejoining the hike. The camp has been one
last buzz of personal talks, excited, pensive, or
regretful.
</p>
<p>But all is quieting now, and I am sleepy. Love,
much love, from

<p>You&#8217;ll see me soon, perhaps sooner than you

out of here. Otherwise I should stay a month
longer. Never had such a good time in my life.
Oh, yes, I remember I&#8217;ve grumbled some; and
I&#8217;ve lost six pounds and worn out two pairs of
shoes. Never put your shoes near the fire or on
a stove. But for hardening of the muscles and
toughening of the hide, give me Plattsburg. If
you have any complaints to make to me at any

</p>
<p>Our David that I&#8217;ve told you about, he turns
out to be a true sport after all. Marches with the
best of us, lives as dirty as we, enjoys it all. The
young cuss, I&#8217;ve grown fond of him. What do
you think his latest is? He&#8217;s kept hammering
at me till he&#8217;s made me stop buying pies and
things! Good for the pocket-book, but particularly
good for my little insides. The last

I&#8217;ve made as much noise as anybody, it was so

idea of not seeing the captain again, and the Professor

<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Mother</span>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>It will be hard for me to hold myself to the
systematic narrative of this last day, I do so
wish to leap to the end and to tell you great
news. But I will be firm.
</p>
<p>I was up early this morning, as I so often am.
There is always the distant cavalry bugle to rouse
one; it blows first. Seeing the embers of our great
fire still glowing in the dusk, I went there to warm
myself, and stood there listening to the sounds
from the still sleepy camp. Drowsy voices, a
footfall here and there, the crackle of fire and
the tinkle of pots at the cook tents. Even when
reveille had blown there was still for several moments
this sleep-drugged quiet, in the first light
of dawn.
</p>
<p>Then there blared out the music of the full
brass band in the opening crash of &#8220;Hail, hail,
the gang&#8217;s on deck!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Silence no more. Yell upon yell, shout upon
shout, cheer upon cheer&mdash;and for a space the
brass could not be heard. The noise subsided to
singing and to laughter, the music again held
sway, and the camp, springing to its work in high
spirits, was beginning on its last day. The last
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
packing, the last mess together; then as the
companies stood in line for the last march out,
the band marched in and out of the company
streets, playing to us for the last time, preceded
by a score of howling dervishes, and followed by
as many others, little Cupid (my second glimpse
of him) struggling along in the rear. Then we
were beginning our march, cheerful though on
macadam, and though we had learned that once
more we must skirmish, and so spoil the new
spotlessness of our rifles. It was a lovely morning,
hazy, but through the mist showing to the
right a mountain with its lower sides glowing
red. Not many miles to go, and we were glad
as we covered each one; but at last we heard behind
us the rifles of the cavalry, and turned to
fight with them a rear-guard engagement.
</p>
<p>There was an hour of it, first and last. It had
its individual features, notably the tale of a squad
which, after marching for some minutes under
the point blank fire of our whole platoon, tried to
outflank and attack us&mdash;but an umpire attended
to them. Yet after all there must be sameness to
my descriptions, and I will press on to the important
matters.
</p>
<p>We were deployed between two highways, one
the main road from Cadyville, one running south
of it. On account of our coming, various motorists
had set out to meet us, and on the northern
road were a number of cars, full of fluttering females.
On the southern road stood but one.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
Now we were supposed to be retiring before a
superior force; but their disposition offering an
excellent chance to give them a jolt, our company
was sent through the southern fields against their
flank. There was much standing stubble and high
weeds in the field through which we stole silently
by rushes, Kirby behind us and urging us on,
using only short blasts of his whistle as signals,
and the vibrant tones of his penetrating voice.
We were less than a hundred yards from the enemy
and he had not discovered us; every man of
us kept low to the ground, and never before had
the company worked so like a machine. Our
squad was on the outer flank, coming along the
broken roadside wall, when I heard someone say
from the lone car that we were approaching.
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t they doing it magnificently?&#8221;
</p>
<p>I knew the voice. It was the old colonel,
standing up in the car to watch us. With him
were Vera, Frances, and their hosts the Chapmans.
</p>
<p>The captain came close up and spoke to us.
&#8220;Corporal, has your flank guard seen any outposts?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bann called across the road to Knudsen.
&#8220;What have you seen?&#8221; He answered &#8220;Nothing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Said the captain, &#8220;After the next rush I shall
send your whole squad across. Forward now to
the line of that row of apple trees ahead.&#8221; And
at Barm&#8217;s &#8220;Follow me!&#8221; we slipped ahead not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
merely to the line of three old trees, but also to
the position of the waiting motor, which was just
abreast of us. While the rest of the company
slipped forward to our line, I took a satisfying
look at the girls. Frances saw me, and we smiled.
Vera was absolutely intent on something behind
me, of course the captain. And still not a shot
from the flank-guard in front, I think a sleepy
platoon under a sergeant. We chuckled. But then
a gun went off in our line somewhere on the right.
We swore. Ahead of us the enemy broke into a
crackle of gunfire, not very heavy.
</p>
<p>In it, so few were the guns that were firing, I
clearly distinguished, among the short dull explosions
of the blanks we know so well, a sharp
and angry crack, followed by a tearing snap right
over my head.
</p>
<p>Surprised, I yet recognized the noise of the
passage of a bullet. A second time!&mdash;and then,
familiar as I am with the legend of the clip of
ball cartridges, I instantly knew it to be true.
And again&mdash;Crack-snap! I heard the old colonel
crying to the ladies, &#8220;Down!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then a long blast of the captain&#8217;s whistle. I
knew he was on his feet behind me, then heard
his voice through the sputter of fire that was
beginning from our own line. &#8220;Cease firing!&#8221;
Over my shoulder I looked at him, a fine manly
figure in the attitude of command, one hand
stretched threateningly toward the line in front.
</p>
<p>Then, as the roar of our guns burst out on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
right, his hat flew backward, I saw blood start
out on his temple, and as if an axe had struck
him, he was down!
</p>
<p>Quickly as I was on my feet, someone was
quicker. A flash of white went past me, and
there was Vera on her knees, gathering into her
lap the head of the fallen man. I heard her little
moaning cry.
</p>
<p>In the few moments that followed I stood
stupidly helpless. Our fire stopped suddenly, as
the sergeants enforced the captain&#8217;s command.
The fire stopped in front. In the little circle of
the branches of the old tree we were quiet as&mdash;yes,
as the grave. Vera, holding the captain&#8217;s
head fiercely close, looked wildly round for help.
It was Frances who slipped by me and with her
handkerchief wiped away the blood that stood
upon the temple.
</p>
<p>Oh, the relief! A long red bruise showed where
the bullet had passed.
</p>
<p>And then he opened his eyes. Vera, looking
down on him, said quite simply, &#8220;Are you all
right, Allan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Was he all right? Was he in heaven? At the
look on his face I turned away with sudden tears
in my eyes. The rest, I know, also avoided that
solemn privacy. As it came about, mother, I
turned toward Frances, and she, quite overcome,
to me. In such a moment of emotion, things
happen. As she rested on my breast, we found
that she belonged there.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>It was the trampling of the major&#8217;s horse that
brought us to ourselves. The captain, though
pale and unsteady, was on his feet. Bannister
had drawn the squad quietly out of the shade of
the tree. They were looking at the landscape;
as for the major, he was most inscrutable, which
happens, you know, when there is something to
scrutinize. Said he very innocently: &#8220;The lieutenant
will take the company in, Captain Kirby.
I think we&#8217;d better ask your friends here to bring
you to the surgeon.&mdash;Call your men together, Mr.
Pendleton!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lieutenant, pale as the captain, yet looking
very resolute, stepped up to him and wrenched
his hand, bowed over Vera&#8217;s, turned about and
blew his whistle. With his hand he signalled the
assembly. And good Bannister, very apologetic
at interrupting my love-making, said diffidently
&#8220;Hem! Squad Eight, fall in!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But I kissed Frances before them all, and helped
the captain into the tonneau, where they established
him very comfortably between the two
girls. It was not till I had got a smile from him
and a proud look from Vera that I went to my
place in the company. As I went I saw out of the
corner of my eye the major and his staff holding
an inquest on the platoon that had fired on us. I
wondered who had had that clip of ball cartridges.
</p>
<p>But they never found out. We rested for a
while at the crossroads, and I can tell you I had to
stand some banter from the squad after the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
motor had shot by us, with Frances&#8217;s handkerchief
fluttering to me. There was very excited
speculation as to the penalty for shooting the
captain; some were for a military execution when
we got to camp, with burial on the drill field.
But the major came and told the lieutenant, and
he passed the word to the company&mdash;the men
who fired on us had used up all their cartridges
and moved from the ground before they had been
accused of the use of ball; no one knew, apparently
not even themselves, who had fired the
dangerous shots. It might happen, you know,
that a stupid or excited man might load with ball
and not be aware of it. As for me, I&#8217;m not
finding any fault, nor are certain others that I
could name.
</p>
<p>The march in to camp? To tell the truth, I
don&#8217;t remember much of it, for I was thinking a
good deal. One poor chap we passed as he waited
for the hospital truck to come along and pick
him up, a disappointed man of fifty, who held
his head down and would not look at us as we
tramped by in sympathetic silence. As we entered
the residence quarter of Plattsburg, where
people lined the streets, the whistles blew Halt
and we were waved to the two sides of the street:
&#8220;Fall out to the right and left.&#8221; We dropped
down on the grass all around a rock where two
pretty girls had ensconced themselves to see us
pass; instead, we saw them run! Then on we
went through the town, marching at attention,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
with everybody out on the streets to watch the
last of the rookies of 1916.
</p>
<p>But when we reached the post there was evidently
to be a March Past, for the band was
playing ahead of us, stationed opposite the general
and his staff. We braced ourselves up, swung
into line&mdash;and there was the captain in front of
us! Very pale he was, with a bit of white bandage
showing under the hat that had the hole in
it. But he was firm on his feet. What a yell for
a moment we let out! Then like veterans we followed
him with his old familiar stride, and if there
was a break in all our line&mdash;no, I can&#8217;t believe it.
We saluted the general, the lieutenant broke us
into column of squads, and then we gave Eyes
Right to the captain, who stood at salute as we
marched by.
</p>
<p>The break-up was a heart-rending affair. So
much had we been delayed by the unexpected
skirmish and the little investigation that there
was only the smallest amount of time to turn in
our equipment, get our baggage, and catch the
trains that would not wait. So in the scrabble
were no real good-bys, no friendly little chats
about the past and future, no appointments for
reunions. I did not even shake hands with Bannister
as he hurried to the boat that for some
reason was his means of getting away. There
were just two little events that I can describe
to you.
</p>
<p>As we marched into camp David was uneasy,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
and acknowledged frankly that he was afraid his
mother would be there to take him home in the
motor. But the familiar strawberry limousine
was nowhere to be seen, and as we swung into
the company street we saw not David&#8217;s mother,
but his father in his ancient Panama and his
wrinkled business suit. The boy shouted his delight,
and when we broke ranks he dragged his
father to the tent and introduced him to as many
of us as he could pin down for a moment. And a
little later, catching both Knudsen and me, he
kept us in the tent while he reminded his father
of a promise. &#8220;You know, father, you said you&#8217;d
give me any kind of an automobile I wanted, if
I stayed through the hike.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Farnham had been deeply pleased, you
could see it in his face, that David had grown so
manly. Consequently he was the more disappointed
at this prompt practical demand. But
though a shade crossed his face, he answered
kindly, &#8220;You&#8217;ve earned it, David.&#8221;
</p>
<p>David put a hand on my arm, and on his other
side drew Knudsen a little closer to him, as if for
support. &#8220;Then, father, I want a Ford!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A Ford?&#8221; cried his father. A Ford! thought
I&mdash;a four hundred dollar car when he might
spend his thousands?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said David, a little unsteadily. &#8220;I want
to learn to take one apart and put it together,
and then I want you to send another Ford ambulance
to France, with me to drive it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>A glorious smile broke over the father&#8217;s face,
of pride, and fondness, yet also of possible sacrifice
of this son who was now first showing his
manhood&mdash;for there is danger in that ambulance
service. I saw the story was true that Mr. Farnham
has been sending ambulances abroad; and
saw also that David had been afraid of his father&#8217;s
opposition to a scheme which he had been hatching
in secret. So he had felt the need of my support
and Knudsen&#8217;s. But the father held out both
hands to his boy, and Knudsen and I slipped
quietly out of the tent and walked together, without
saying a word, down to the edge of the drill-field.
</p>
<p>Said Knudsen then: &#8220;Since it&#8217;s settled now,
that silly mother can&#8217;t interfere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I was feeling pleased that though at first I had
studiously neglected David, he had needed me
now. Knudsen&#8217;s mind travelled much the same
road.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A good investment,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the trouble
we&#8217;ve put into that youngster.&#8221;
</p>
<p>I had a little talk with Mr. Farnham before the
train went. He was overflowing with happiness.
David had somehow got the idea of service, and
unknown to us had been planning his life by it.
First to help in this emergency in France, then to
find some way in which a rich man could give his
time to his country, in some branch of public
service. It was fixed in his mind that next summer
he must be at Plattsburg again, working for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
a commission in the reserve. Beyond that he
would need his father&#8217;s advice and help.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So there&#8217;s something more in life for me now,&#8221;
said the father, &#8220;than the mere making of
money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was in the midst of all the hurry and confusion
of our getting ready to go that I heard a great
shouting at the head of the street, and going to
see, found the captain there, and Vera watching
from a little distance. He had come to take personal
leave of those he knew best, shook hands
with every one, called scores of us by name,
thanked us all for our help in his work, showed
in his face his great new happiness. When those
who pressed upon him first had gone away,
driven by the necessity that was on all of them,
he called me to him and made me promise not to
leave with the rest, but at least to stay overnight&mdash;for
we were to be brothers now, he said, and
must know each other better before we separated.
While a new group came and talked with him I
went to Vera.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Frances is waiting in the car outside,&#8221; she
said, scarcely glancing at me, but with eager eyes
watching the captain and the men who still pressed
upon him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he popular now?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;Do the men
love him? Don&#8217;t you approve of him a little bit
yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>This roused her into giving me all her attention
for a moment. &#8220;Oh, Dick,&#8221; she cried, remembering,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
&#8220;if it hadn&#8217;t been for what you said to
him, perhaps&mdash;!&#8221; She couldn&#8217;t quite express the
tragedy that would have followed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it would have taken a little longer,
that is all,&#8221; I said. &#8220;There, watch him, do.&#8221;
For in spite of herself her eyes would stray back
to him. &#8220;Frances will be nice to me.&#8221; And
Frances was, until I told her I must go back to
the boys.
</p>
<p>There was a minute or two here and there
that I could get from the busy men. But mostly
I helped them get away, cleaned their guns,
handed in their stuff, helped them pack, lugged
their baggage with them to the train. Knudsen
and I and Clay had one last short walk together,
up and down the embankment beside the train,
soberly vowing friendship for the future. Then
the conductor gave the signal, they climbed aboard,
there was a short half-minute of waving of good-bys,
and I walked back alone across the empty
drill field.
</p>
<p>I am sitting now upon my bag in the tent which
has so often rung with our laughter or buzzed with
our talk. Here are the ridges and hollows made
by our feet, over in the corner are Clay&#8217;s old shoes,
and near me lie three empty shells that David
threw out of his pocket. Our equipment is all
turned in, the buzzards in our absence carried
everything else away, and this lonely silence is
more than I can bear. In a few minutes I shall
close this last letter to you; then Frances will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
come in the car to take me to a telegraph office,
where I shall wire you that she and I are starting
home tomorrow with the Chapmans, and shall
not be home for three days more. As I shall
hint at the reason, you will understand and will
forgive me this delay. I know, dear mother,
that your heart always was with Frances, after all.
</p>
<p>And so good-by to Plattsburg!
